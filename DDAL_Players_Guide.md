# D&D® Adventurers League Player's Guide

**Effective Date: December 19, 2022.**

## What is this?

This document provides you with the rules for creating and advancing characters within the D&D Adventurers League, an official organized play program for Dungeons & Dragons.

Companions to this document include the **D&D Adventurers League Dungeon Master's Guide** and the **D&D Adventurers League FAQ**. Note that this document is not a comprehensive guide to all possible adjudications; see the companion documents above for more information.

This document covers participation in D&D Adventurers League adventures in the following campaign worlds: the Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Ravenloft, and Dragonlance.

## Creating a Character

Use the character creation rules as presented in the *Player's Handbook (PH)*, with the following notes. You begin play at 1st level.

***Step 0: Choose Your Campaign.*** You may choose to attach your character to the Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Ravenloft, or Dragonlance campaign. Your choice affects a few rulebook options available to you and limits your adventures to those attached to a specific campaign or available to more than one campaign. Once your choice is made, you cannot change it for that character after you've played your first adventure.

***Step 1: Choose a Race or Lineage.*** See the sidebar for available rules choices. Custom lineages found in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* are available.

***Step 2: Choose a Class.*** See the sidebar for available rules choices.

***Step 3: Determine Ability Scores.*** Your ability scores are generated using one of the following methods.

- Standard set (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8).
- Variant: Customizing Ability Scores *(PH)*.

***Step 4: Describe Your Character.*** See the sidebar for available rules choices.

- **Alignment:** Choose a non-evil alignment.
- **Background:** You can create a custom background or use any available background as presented. If you choose a background that does not grant a feat, you may choose one of the following feats for your character: Skilled or Tough.
- **Deity:** You may choose any deity to worship from official rulebooks that is unique to your campaign world or is not unique to another world. Clerics must choose a deity.
- **Faction:** You may choose one faction at character creation or anytime the opportunity arises during play. Benefits for faction membership are detailed within adventures where relevant. The starting factions are listed in appendix C in the *Basic Rules*. You may only have membership in one faction at a time and may switch whenever you'd like.

***Step 5: Choosing Equipment.*** Your starting equipment and gold are determined by your class and background. You don't roll for gold. You may start with a trinket of your choice from available rules choices. You can sell starting equipment using the rules in the *PH* and can buy equipment and spell components found in the *PH* or available rules.

### Starting Play at 5th Level

You may choose to create a 5th level character instead of starting at 1st level. As a 5th level character, you may choose one of the following magic items to possess in addition to your standard gear from your class and background.

- *+1 weapon*
- *+1 shield*
- *+1 rod of the pact keeper*
- *+1 wand of the war mage*
- *+1 all-purpose tool (TCE)*
- *+1 amulet of the devout (TCE)*
- *+1 arcane grimoire (TCE)*
- *+1 bloodwell vial (TCE)*

## Playing Adventures

You can play any adventures you'd like that are available as a part of the D&D Adventurers League, provided you meet the level requirement for play. Each adventure has a tier, which tells you what level characters can participate in it.

### Tier by Character Level

Character Level | Tier
--- | ---
1 – 4 | 1
5 – 10 | 2
11 – 16 | 3
17 – 20 | 4

> #### Playing official D&D adventures
>
> Long adventures such as *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight* have different rules for leveling. You may "leave" those adventures at specified points to play other adventures, but you may be ineligible to return if you level your character outside of the book adventure. Consult with your Dungeon Master.

### Logsheets

You should use a logsheet to track rewards and note any other important information from play of an adventure. Identify each adventure and session by providing a code (listed on many adventures) or a title (for official D&D products). A logsheet is available on the [official website](https://dnd.wizards.com/ddal_general).

### Leveling Up

You gain a level at the end of each play session that completes an Adventurers League adventure or a part of an official D&D adventure, at your discretion. If you'd like to continue playing at your current level, you can decline to gain a level. You keep any rewards earned.

You gain hit points listed as the fixed value for your class (plus any modifiers) when you level up.

Whenever you could gain a level, you may rebuild any aspect of your character. See "Rebuilding" below.

Once you achieve 5th level, you may choose a magic item as presented in "Starting Play at 5th Level" above.

#### Rebuilding

Whenever you like, you can rebuild your character. However, you only retain equipment and magic items earned by adventuring and lose access to any items gained from class features. If you rebuild back to the class, you regain access to those items.

### Rewards

Whenever you have the option to level up and at other times during play, you'll earn rewards. These may include the following:

- Magic items
- Coins and other treasure
- Story awards
- Event awards

#### Magic Items

Whenever your party finds a magic item during play, the party determines who has it for the remainder of the adventure. At the end of play, any number of characters may keep the magic item (including consumable items) if it wasn't consumed or destroyed during play. You may keep as many magic items as you are awarded but must limit the number of magic items you bring to play sessions.

##### Carried magic items by tier

Tier | Uncommon+ | Common | Consumable
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | 1 | 5 | 5
2 | 3 | 5 | 10
3 | 6 | 5 | 10
4 | 10 | 5 | 15

Uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, and unique permanent magic items are included in the "Uncommon+" column. Common permanent magic items are included in the "Common" column. Consumable items include any magic item that is consumed if used (potions, scrolls, ammunition, etc.). If an item is destroyed, consumed, or lost during play, it is removed from your character and cannot be reacquired unless rewarded again through play.

Legendary magic items may only be used in tier 4 play. Characters of lower tiers that encounter a legendary magic item as a reward may possess it, but it remains unavailable for use until 17th level.

Additional magic items may be available through events, such as a trading post or a special play opportunity. These items are subject to the magic item limits presented above.

#### Coins and Other Treasure

Whenever your party finds treasure of a monetary value, they can keep it with them to use during play. Any remaining treasure unused at the end of the adventure is converted to gold pieces and divided evenly between all the characters. The Dungeon Master can assist in this process.

Mundane items, such as found equipment, are divided however the party chooses at the end of the play session. Your Dungeon Master will have more specific guidance on mundane items as treasure.

#### Story Awards

Sometimes you may earn a story award. This is a special award or item, sometimes presented as a certificate, that may have significance in future adventures in the same storyline and has no effect outside of that storyline.

Whenever applicable, the Dungeon Master may ask if any of the characters in the party possess a story award. In certain circumstances, such as the case of story items, the party may have to determine who has it for the purposes of that adventure.

#### Event Awards

You may attend an event and receive a certificate, such as a pet or interesting trinket, as a reward for participation or engaging in a specific activity. These rewards are attached to the player, not a specific character. At the beginning of each play session, you may select one event award you possess to use. You may only have one event award active at any time, and event awards do not count as a carried magic item.

### Death, Disease, and Curses

During sessions of play, if you die, are subject to a lingering effect such as a disease or curse, or removed from the adventure, you deal with the consequences for the duration of the session of play. At that session's conclusion, you may choose the following fate:

- You return your character to life or remove the negative effect. If you were removed from the adventure, you gain rewards earned until removed. You may gain a level.
- You retire the character, succumbing to your fate.

If you are returned to the adventure before the conclusion of the session of play, you may earn all the rewards offered to the party, including during your absence.

### Dungeon Masters and Rewards

Your Dungeon Master may have additional guidance through documentation on adjudicating specific rewards. If you have questions using a particular reward during play, ask your Dungeon Master.

## Between Play Sessions

### Buying and Trading Gear

You can sell and buy equipment and spell components using the rules in the *Player's Handbook*. *Spell scrolls* and potions can be purchased for prices listed under Appendix A: Shared Campaigns in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* in addition to any component costs.

- Equipment and consumable items can be lent to other characters during play but must return at the end of the session (unless it's been consumed or lost).
- Permanent magic items (including legendary magic items) can be traded (see below). Unique magic items may not be traded.

Trading permanent magic items with other characters in your character's campaign is on a one-for-one basis of equivalent rarity. Certificates (if present) must also be traded or destroyed. You cannot trade with characters attached to a campaign world other than the one you've chosen for your character.

### Downtime

You earn 10 downtime days between each session of play. Your character can participate in downtime activities between sessions as listed under "Downtime Activities" in the *Player's Handbook*. The following additional downtime activities are available; all others are unavailable unless offered in an adventure.

***Catching Up.*** Spend 10 downtime days to gain a level.

***Copying Spells.*** If you can copy spells, you may use the rules presented in the "Your Spellbook" sidebar in the *Player's Handbook* to copy spells found in adventures, except it costs 1 downtime day for each spell up to 4th level and 2 downtime days for each spell 5th level and above. If you are copying spells from another character's spellbook, you may do so immediately after a session of play in which both characters were present. You are always successful at copying spells from scrolls.

***Brewing Potions.*** You may brew *potions of healing* as presented under "Crafting an Item" in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. A "workweek" is defined as 5 downtime days. You do not suffer a complication when engaging in this activity. Potions brewed count towards your consumable item limit.

***Scribing Scrolls.*** You may scribe *spell scrolls* as presented under "Scribing a Spell Scroll" in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*. A "workweek" is defined as 5 downtime days.. You do not suffer a complication when engaging in this activity. Scrolls scribed count towards your consumable item limit.

***Trading Magic Items.*** Whenever you trade a magic item, you spend 5 downtime days.
