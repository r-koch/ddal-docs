# D&D Adventureres League Admin Answers

This information is taken from the [al-rules-compendium channel](https://discord.com/channels/516367331358801950/1049795363999055883) of the [Dungeons & Dragons discord server](https://discord.gg/dnd).

## Player's Guide Questions

### Is not having **codes for hardcovers** going to be the norm going forward?

Yes. You can use titles. However you document your character log, make sure it is clear for the Dungeon Masters who might review it.
 
### Are characters who found **magic items prior to season 11** (when legendary items were "held on reserve" until tier 4) still considered to have them? 

Yes, if your character has a Legendary magic item they found before this season, they still have it.

### I have a **certificate from a charity event** I'm not using. Can I give it away?

Charity event certificates (like for Extra Life fundraising) and the older exclusively-made certificates AL admin used to make for specific events can be given as a gift--if they've never been used and do not have a player's or character's name on it.

They're never tradable for another item between characters.

### Can **player characters (PCs) from different campaigns** play at the same table? And if they can, can they **trade magic items**?

They can play together as long as the adventure they play is allowed in each of their campaigns.

The player's guide does not allow them to trade magic items (see the last sentence of "Buying and Trading Gear").

### Which document takes priorityâ€”ALPG (**gain a level** at the end of a HC session or end of adventure) or Adaption Guides (gain levels when a prerequisite is met)?

Use the ALPG guidance in this case.

### *Eberron: Oracle of War: Salvage Bases and Missions* has been removed from DMsGuild.com and is not listed in the ALPG. Is content from it still playable?

*Eberron: Oracle of War: Salvage Bases and Missions* is no longer available for use.

For example, salvage missions cannot be published using that document. But a new Dungeoncraft program has started for the Eberron setting. Salvage Missions published previously on the DMs Guild are still playable according to the player's guide (v13.0).

If you have an existing base built in a previous adventure, it is not destroyed but *Eberron: Oracle of War: Salvage Bases and Missions* can no longer be used to build or upgrade bases. For new bases, see the Eberron: Rising from the Last War "Home Base."

Arcane Manufactory is no longer available. Magic items previously created using *Eberron: Oracle of War: Salvage Bases and Missions* are not removed but they cannot be traded.

We are moving the FAQ information from the website's Oracle of War DM and Player's Guides (https://dnd.wizards.com/adventurers-league). Continue to use those FAQs until then (replacing Volo's and Tome of Foes with *Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*).


### Can a **magic item created by a player character** be traded?

No. PC-created magic items are not tradable. 

### Player's Guide Questions: Character Build and Rebuild
 
#### When **re-writing your character**, the only changes that occur are creation. According to a post a while back from an admin, your starting equipment does not even change, but I am not sure if that was ever officially clarified. In either case, any choices you made at the end of adventures in regards to DT expenditures or magic items selection etc.. remain unchanged. If you change from a Wizard to a Fighter for instance, you still paid the Gold and DT to scribe the spells but no longer have access to them. 

Per the ALPG: "Your character keeps any rewards and equipment earned to that point. If your character's class or background changes, they lose any equipment that it granted, along with the proceeds from selling it, or benefits derived from it, such as copied spells or gold earned by selling it. " 
 
#### If you change your class, you lose the equipment it granted. Starting equipment, spellbooks, etc., etc., etc.--that is an interesting point: you wouldn't lose copied 'spells' themselves that you exchanged with a fellow wizard player before the character rebuild; just the 'spellbook' they are written in? (since that is a class feature). 

If they're spells you copied into a spellbook that you didn't receive by viture of being a wizard. I.e., if you bought a second spellbook, you'd keep spells that you copied via the downtime activity. Spells that you learned by gaining levels, and the spellbook you receive by virtue of being a wizard would be lost. (edited)
 
#### Are there plans for grung to be legal? 

I (Amy) can pass the request on to our team, but it's not currently on the radar. 
 
#### Are there any plans to add Oathbreaker paladin? 

Not at this time. 
 
#### Is there guidance, deadlines, and restrictions on **rebuilding your character**? 

When you first build a 1st level character you follow a campaign's available sources and guidelines. If you choose to rebuild that player character (PC) (while keeping what your character earned from gameplay so far) you must still follow that campaign's available sources and guidelines. The following are a few examples of rebuilds.

- New DDAL specific or WoTC general rules may require making character build adjustments before a PC plays their next session. 
- Sometimes mistakes are made and a PC needs some rebuild adjustments so they are within the campaign's guidelines. 
- Newly available sources and rules open up new races, classes, backgrounds, etc. that may interest a player more than their first build. 
- A player may realize they aren't having fun (with that class, the background isn't fitting how they are playing them, their playstyle is more suited for ranged attacks, they aren't getting the hang of spellcasting, etc.). 

There are no longer restrictions on rebuilding your PC other than following the sources and guidelines for the campaign you are currently in or joining. Your rebuild can be at any level (it's no longer restricted to tier 1). There's no deadline that says you have until X time to rebuild all of your PCs even if you aren't playing them right now. You can rebuild your PC by the next time you play. The openness (lack of deadline and restrictions other than those in character creation) provides some freedoms but we depend on the honor system here and the respect of the table so that play isn't disrupted.

#### I would assume if you **rebuild out of being an Artificer**, you lose magic items you crafted, right?

Correct. 

#### One of the few rules or mechanical things D&D has done that can be geared specifically towards the LGBTQIA+ community is no longer legal in AL play (**Blessed of Corellon**). What is going to be done to fix this? 

Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (MTF) is a discontinued book which is causing many folks valid concerns about not being able to roleplay the Blessed of Corellon. As a nonbinary trans person I understand the desire for more trans representation in D&D and will keep advocating for that. In my time as a D&D Adventurers League admin my favorite guidelines-change has been "you may rebuild any aspect of your character." That means we don't need to use lore that only allows elves' to change their sex or gender. All players can change any of their characters' sex and gender as they wish, as many times as they wish, regardless of their background. Lolth and discontinued lore can't stop you. No one should stop you. 
 
MTF isn't an available resource anymore so D&D Adventurers League can't expect players to have access to it as a reference book anymore. But what we can do is continue to support player's agency over their character builds, changing any elements they wish, as long as they keep what they've earned from playing adventures. Please keep respectfully playing your genderfluid characters. 
 
Good adventuring to all my trans friends and player characters! 

#### We can't use out-dated or discontinued sources (MTF). What if an adventure says to rebuild player characters (PCs) from them (yuan-ti pureblood transformation)?

Use the most current and similar guidance (rebuild with Monsters of the Multiverse's yuan-ti).

#### What's been said about representation and not locking disabled PCs out of classes, etc.?

> Your disability shouldn't be used as a reason to deny or hinder your abilities and actions. - https://www.dmsguild.com/product/387334/RMH10-Scion-of-Darkness?affiliate_id=925821

An arm amputee can use a two-handed weapon. Abios' had a thorough reply regarding this property:

> From a mechanical perspective, "two-handed" is just a tag. What it means is: When you are wielding the weapon, you have 0 free hands (this means e.g. you cannot be using another weapon at the same time, nor be holding another hand-held item such as a shield - you are still able to touch something but you're not able to hold it and use the weapon at the same time).
>
> The TH weapon qualifies for certain features/feats and does not qualify for others. As long as you don't try to use your character's lack of a hand as a way to bypass any of these points, your lack of a hand is simply a flavour/RP element and you're good to go.

## Dungeon Master's Guide Questions

### If an NPC offers each **character -their choice- from a selection of magic items** do those items duplicate for every player at the end of the adventure?

No, "those items do not 'duplicate' at the end of the adventure." "aka a member of the party does not get all the items" 
 
### Can I reward something in HC as long as its part of the **magic item** list [not a story item] and its italicize?"

Yes, as long as it's italicized. "If the adventure is available to the public, then it is fair game provided a specific magic item reward is listed." â€“ CT

### Can DMs give players **trinkets**.

DMs may give players non-mechanical, non-valuable, non-tradable trinkets. 

### Clarification on the **item table rolls**. If there's a mixed tier party (let's say Tier 1 and Tier 3) and the party is allowed to roll on Table D. Since table D only contains Very Rare/Rare items does the party get to roll of the next "downgraded table" (in this case Table C) or is the rule that if the party gets to roll on a magic item table but cannot obtain items due to rarity then they just don't get anything? I know most tables have multiple rarities on them but unsure on what to do in this instance for tables with a non-tier appropriate rarity. 

They can obtain/possess the item in this instance, provided specific adaptation guidance doesn't overrule the general rule. The only restriction as per the rules on carrying/using a magic item is for legendary items. Yes, it's is theoretically possible for a low-level character to possess and carry a very rare magic item.
 
### What is the difference between mundane treasure and equipment? 

**Treasure** is coins, gems, art objects, and any other portable mundane valuablesâ€”with no other use than as currency. Other portable itemsâ€”as listed in the **Equipment** section of the Player's Handbook(PH)â€”may also be obtained during the adventure (weapons, armor, and tools). 

Relevant reading: Player's Guide "Coins and Other Treasure," DMs Guide "Mundane Equipment and Treasure" section, FAQ "Treasure" and "Equipment in Stat Blocks" sections. Dungeoncraft designers reading: Dungeoncraft Design Guide "Rewards" section, beginning with the "Treasure such as..." paragraph. 

### **Mundane equipment** found during an adventure (as listed treasure or looted from enemy stat blocks) can be sold for 1/2 price before the end of the session. Once sold can the gp be distributed amongst the party?

After the PH Equipment is distributed "however the party chooses" (Player's Guide) then "characters may earn gold by selling claimed mundane equipment for 1/2 its value" (FAQ). That gold can be shared amongst the party if the player chooses. 
 

### How should DMs adjudicate **item rewards that were once listed as story items or problematic** under the Season 9 Adventurers League Content Catalogue (ALCC v9.02) but are not addressed in current documentation?

This information will be added to the adaption guides. For now, continue to use the attached ALCC v9.02. 

## FAQ (General Questions)

### Can Forgotten Realms characters with ***find greater steed*** summon a dragonnel?

Yes.

### "**Consumable resources**" are "spell slots, rages, etc," class features and racial traits that are regained after a rest. Are magic items that regain charges daily included? Do players roll like normal or do the magic items restore their full charges?

Yes, magic items that regain charges daily are considered "consumable resources." You do not need to roll, they are restored to their full charge as they would the next day. 

## Forgotten Realms Adaption Guide

## Service Rewards Questions

none currently

## Candlekeep Mysteries Questions

### At the end of "The Scrivener's Tale" in Candlekeep Mysteries: the last sentence of the "Treasure" section lists possible rewards as "If the characters want to sell the collection, you can decide what it might be worth, but the characters should earn at least 50,000 gp for the lot (see also "A Little Light Reading" below). Such a reward might take the form of one or two very rare magic items, a small keep, a large parcel of land, or a seaworthy galley with a full crew." What is the guidance on what we can reward? 
 
Use the reward specified in the adventure, 50,000 gp only to the party. The other items, including the very rare items mentioned in Amy's previous guidance, are not rewardable.

### Question about CM-10 "Kandlekeep Dekonstruktion" - in the content catalog, it states: "Stonky's Control Ring. Stonky's ring ceases to function at the end of this adventure and the skitterwidgets found in this adventure can not be claimed by the characters." Does this mean that the players should not be awarded the ring of telekinesis? Or does that mean that they get the ring, but not the extra function to control the constructs?
 
Characters receive the ring, but the skitterwidget control portion of it no longer functions.

### Question about some guidance in Zikran's Zephyrean Tome: Conclusion. Gazre-Azam do not offer to cast wish, but rather gives the party a censor of controlling air elementals that only summons him. He does not enchant the book, so the characters can return it to Candlekeep. 

#### Does the censor summon Gazre-Azam with the djinni statblock or the air elemental statblock? 

Gazre-Azam is summoned as an air elemental. 

#### Is the djinni subject to the same effect for conjure elemental where if concentration breaks the summoned elemental becomes hostile to the party? 

This is a DM call, based on how the party may be using him. Are they having him do good/helpful things or are they abusing him? Basically like any other NPC, but [Greg] would probably say at the very best, he probably leaves if they lose concentration.

## Icewind Dale Questions

### "Just to clarify: **DDAL10-00** rewards 1 or 2 level ups if ran as 1 session? I had mixed answers earlier."

For the general release of 10-00 and 10-01, it's one level each after the entire adventure. It was run differently for the previews, but it is no longer that way.
 
### In the **DDAL00-13** Knuckleheads encounter "The Thing in the Ice", one of the possibilities of things in ice are feathers that can be crafted into 10 arrows with wild magic properties. 1) Can characters keep them, if found? 2) If keepable, how are these arrows classified? (mundane trinkets, consumable magic item (like other magical ammo), permanent magic item, etc.)

They are indeed consumable magical ammo. 
 
### Is there Guidance on the Spark of Vlagomir in *Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden*?

Not much guidance to give out on that. It's a general rule question; your DM has hold on that. We can touch on durations and stuff, but otherwise, talk to your DM. In this case, it's really going use the general v. specific rule.

## Eberron Questions
 
### In the Player Guide 1.3 for Oracle of War is stated: Once per adventure that you gain a level, you can scribe one spell into your spellbook [â€¦] Does a **level gained** through a Salvage Mission count for this rule?

Yes, it does. 
 
### So for the OoW campaign there's a ERftLW errata: https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/ERftLW-Errata.pdf which says " Replicate Magic Item (p. 63). The following sentence has been added to the end of the first paragraph: "Alternatively, you can choose the magic item from among the common magic items in the game, not including potions or scrolls." Additionally, the third paragraph has been cut. " My question is about the phrase "**in the game**". I can guess what you're going to say, but the errata says what it says. So, what constitutes being "in the game"?

For Oracle of War, "in the game" would mean "in campaign-legal sources."
 
### In EB 11 *My Undying Heart*: Is the +1 armor/barding made of metal/materials listed in the PHB or can it be **druid friendly**?

The designers will allow druid-friendly armor materials. 
 
### In EB-07 and after the module can the soar sled still dash? The ability grants a flight speed to the disk itself, not the character. So can a disk dash or be dashed by a character?

Usually a vehicle cannot dash but because the soarsled is based on a flying broom and those can dash (https://twitter.com/JeremyECrawford/status/953363603033214976), the soarsled can dash.

### The Embers of the Last War aren't mentioned in the "Eberron" Campaign Worlds section. Are they still playable?

Yes. They will be added to the list on the next Player's Guide update. 

## Ravenloft Questions
 
### What options do wizards/tomelocks/ritual casters have to **record new spells** in Mist Hunters? Seems like a challenge with how gold rewards work in the campaign. The Order provides everything you need to copy spells, including funding. So are downtime requirements just ignored in Mist Hunters for Wizard copying of spells? I.e., The Order provides the downtime, too? 
 
There are no downtime requirements for copying spells in Mist Hunters. 
 
### Is there **downtime** at all? Can a character still use downtime activities from the PH or do we assume downtime does not happen at all? --Have you had a chance to find out what happens if a character dies? Do they get automatically rezzed before the next session? -- If we need a resurrection, are we subjected to the -4 penalty until a certain number of long rests have passed? How do we handle the passing of time in the absence of downtime? 
 
There's no downtime in Mist Hunters at all. To quote Travis: "They start their character fresh each adventure. Really, in the grand scheme of things, the only things that's going to carry over are what's in the investigation journal."
 
### Is **House of Lament** from *Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft* AL-legal? 
 
It is not, though players who complete it during a Virtual Play Weekend will gain a benefit they can use for their character in the Ravenloft: Mist Hunters campaign. 

## Red Wizard Questions

### In regard to organizers receiving event support for the Red War epic: The tier 4 epic awards two boons if the simulacrum is destroyed. The old ALCC used to reward the players' a choice of one boon to each character who survived the adventure, but did not destroy the simulacrum. Is that reward still available?

Yes.

## Spelljammer Questions

### The adaption guide says "for play in a time-controlled, public setting, such as a convention or at a scheduled event at your local game store, school, or library." Is it **only playable in those locations**?

Any D&D Adventurers League (DDAL) player can play *Journey through the Radiant Citadel* anywhere there is a DDAL DM running it.
 
### The book has suggestions for placing each of the lands within Forgotten Realms. For example, it says that **Godsbreath** could be in Turmish or Featherdale. Are such FR modifications required or recommended?

They are options, not requirements.
 
### Could you also check on guidance for **mundane equipment given as a quest reward** but not in an explicit "treasure" section?

Following guidance, they are not obtainable.
 
### If a Spelljammer Academy adventure does not have **gold awards** mentioned do we follow the guidance in the ALDM v11.0?

> Treasure (including items that have a monetary value but are not equipment, such as art objects and gems) is awarded as the adventure directs. It can be spent during the adventure; any remaining treasure at the end of the adventure is converted to gold pieces and divided equally among the characters. If the adventure does not have treasure awarded in this fashion (such as some official D&D Adventurers League adventures), you may add a treasure reward as appropriate either during play or at the end of the adventure. Use the following table for guidance. 
> UNSPECIFIED TREASURE ALLOWANCE PER ADVENTURE 
> Adventure Level Minimum Maximum 
> Levels 1-4 (Tier 1) 100 gp 500 gp 

Yes!

### Do the Spelljammer Academy adventures need to be **played in sequence** (Orientation followed by Trial by Fire, etc.)? And are they limited to the level they are designed for (Only level 1 player characters can play Orientation, only level 2 PCs can play Trial by Fire)?

The adventures were designed as stated in their "Introduction" section and are intended to be played in order, as a 1st level PC playing Orientation, a 2nd level PC playing Trial by Fire, and so on. However, as an option for SJA Adventurers League play DMs and event organizers may allow characters in tier 1 (levels 1-4) to play the adventures in any order. This fits with the Gen Con wording. Players can keep leveling guidance in mind ("Leveling Up" section of the Player's Guide) and decline levels if needed so they don't advance above 4th level before finishing all the SJA adventures they wish to play. This information will be added to supplementary documentation.
 
### As a DM I have questions about how to run the **ship combat**. Can information be provided?

All the important information you need is provided in the handouts (speed, weapons, crew size, etc.). All other combat decision you make as the DM are up to your discretion.

### How do we prevent or what can we do if the **party doesn't have a spellcaster**? 

A character with the ability to cast even one spell can be a spelljammer. You can have a pre-game discussion so they have more information while choosing their characters or time to rebuild. With or without the discussion, if needed, use the apprentice wizard from Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse (https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560723-apprentice-wizard) as a cadet.

## Dungeoncraft (DC) Questions 
 
### Will we get DCs for for **Tiers 4**?

Not for the Spelljammer DC. In the future, I don't have any idea.
 
### Can our setting be set in other locations like a **mindscape or dreamscape**?

We need to keep DC adventures in the listed locations. If the listed location is not a mindscape, dreamscape, or other type of location then they are not allowed, not even briefly.
 
### Can a DC adventure be written as "a **2 or 4 hour adventure**" or "a **2 to 4 hour** adventure?"

Claire confirms it can be either, not both.
 
### Is there going to be any possibility of approval for things **outside of DCs** or is this it?

For now, no. Wizards may review how everything goes but we don't anticipate major changes to what is provided here.
 
### Can we **change a monster's spells** to higher levels?

No, we cannot make any changes to stat blocks that would affect a creature's challenge rating (CR).
 
### Can we **give the "final boss" a magic item**? Like if your final enemy wears the Boots of the Winterlands, they'd have resist to cold damage and ignore ice/snow difficult terrain, which changes the difficulty if not strictly the CR.

It is fine to inform the DM, in the module's running text, that the magic item is available to the encounter creature for use. However it is not permitted to make additions or adjustments to the stat block or through a sidebar. In addition, authors cannot write adventure body text that changes stats, like reducing/increasing speed, attacks, damage, etc. 

### What **timezone** do we use to post our adventure in time for the deadline?

EST/EDT If the deadline for uploading DCs to the DMs Guild is missed, see the guide for how to continue running it as DDAL content, without posting to the DMs Guild. DCs uploaded after the deadline are contacted by the DMs Guild and instructed on next steps.

### For the purpose of the DungeonCraft program (which allows 1 to 3 consumables to be awarded) OR trading in AL, are the following items considered to be **consumables**? They seem to fit the definition in the AL documentation, but I don't want to write an invalid DC or make an illegal trade.

1. Spellwrought Tattoo
2. Dust of Disappearance
3. Oil of Slipperiness
4. Bead of Nourishment
5. Pixie Dust
6. Keoghtom's Ointment

Looking at it logically and also checking the, Season 11 Players Guide & FAQ and the various item descriptions, these would count as consumables, but they( the authors & players) should remember that Keoghtom's counts as 3 consumables for the purpose of how many consumables you can carry. NOTE: The party can only keep one item of a given name; multiple spellwrought tattoos would probably only allow for one to be kept, per the ALPG.
 
### Only **one consumable** per adventure can be smokepowder/gunpowder (which is awarded in a packet which is good for five shots). 

#### Can we award gunpowder?

No, just award smokepowder.

#### Can we award bullets?

Yes, award the same number of smokepowder shots, 5. 
 
### Does adding the property: "**Unusual Nature**. The creature doesn't require air." as suggested in Boo's Astral Menagerie count as an addition we can put below a stat block that does not change the creatures CR?

You may add "Unusual Nature" without it changing the CR. 

### To increase **accessibility** can we adjust the DC template or produce a new version?

During your writing, editing, and pdf creation process please make your adventures more accessible for assistive technologies (screen readers, braille displays, screen magnifiers, text-to-speech, and more) and increase visual readability.

1. The DC template must be one of your downloads. Adjust it to create a pdf using tags, bookmarks, alt text, and accessibility improvements that don't change anything about the formatting or appearance of the template.
2. Additionally, as an option create a non-DC-template version; change fonts, sizing, formatting, and layout as advised by accessibility experts.

Resources like those compiled by community member, Kit Flowers, can help. https://www.flowerstorm.tech/tabletop-creator-resources-for-tabletop-accessibility/

Do not sell your versions separately on the DMs Guild.
 
### What permissions do I need for **language translations** of DDAL content?

For translating Dungeoncraft adventures, collaborate with the authors and negotiate some form of compensation. The translation should be included with the original version on DMsGuild.com, not sold separately. Before translating official D&D Adventurers League content (guidelines, Ravenloft: Mist Hunters series, Dreams of the Red Wizards, etc) make a "Permission Request" at the Wizards of the Coast Support page (https://support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000002843). DDAL admin don't give permission.

### Can designers sell only the **Roll20 version** without the DC template version?

No, all DC downloads must have a DC template version, even if selling a VTT version. To do that bundle a private DC pdf and a private VTT version (FG or Roll20) so the royalties are divided correctly. I will update you if this changes.

## Premier Organizer Created Adventures Questions 

### Will the premier organizer (PO) **epics continue to be available** through the event/resource team by all communities? Will they continue to be made available on DM's Guild and/or with single-table variants? Will there be any checks and balances (e.g. price, distribution, publication timeline) on ensuring that they continue to be fairly accessible to all communities, and not just the POs?

As one of the POs doing these, and we have a ton of experience on this front, I can say for the DRW storyline that we will have a public facing schedule of all adventures (normal and epics), their premiere dates, and DMG release dates out as far into the future as we can so other organizers and events can make the decisions they need to make in a timely fashion. We have no plans at this time for any content that will not be released on the DMG and I can promise all DRW content will always be released. We got ya. No worries. 
 
### Are there plans to **add more POs** to the program, particularly POs outside the US?

We're looking to expand our premier organizer partner program in the near future and will have more information about requirements in October.

## Event Organizer Questions

### Can we make adjustments to the AL logo for our Discord Server, etc?

We would prefer that you do not. The AL logo is a Wizards trade mark, is not covered under their Fan Content/Fair Use policy, [and] Wizards material may not be altered. https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/fan-site-kit

- website with links to the new guides, *Spelljammer: Adventures in Space* and *Journeys Through the Radiant Citadel* Adaption Guides, *Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep* Pack, and service awards. (I will update when I have more specific release date from WotC) 

## Questions I'm Awaiting Answers To 

### If you buy a sailing boat from PHB, can you put a **teleportation circle** on it? Or just buildings (FAQ)?

No answer yet.

### Can a **spelljamming helm** convert an existing PC-owned ship into a spelljammer?

No answer yet.

### Missing from current guides: 

#### PCs proficient with martial weapons have **proficiency in firearms**.

No answer yet.

#### OoWPG 1.4 guidance: "Magic items can be created in Oracle of War as long as the ability to create them is an ability granted by something either in the legal Oracle of War sources or specific campaign documentation. For the artificer's **Magic Item Adept** ability, the rules for crafting magic items from XGE should be used. Rather than using workweeks, the creating character can create an item at every even-numbered artificer level (10, 12, 14, etc.)." Any changes to previous guidance? Does Magic Item Adept apply to all campaigns?

No answer yet.

### In the Dragonlance adaption guide we do not have guidance on the **Warriors of Krynn** board game text boxes for optional play. Are they AL playable?

No answer yet.

### Since "**salvage missions do not reward characters with gold and magic items**. Instead, characters gain salvage they can use to improve their base, and a chance to advance in level" and Eberron: Oracle of War: Salvage Bases and Missions is no longer a valid source for AL play, how should DMs give rewards for Salvage Mission adventures? "Can we follow the 'Rewards' rules in the Eberron Dungeoncraft document (ex.: reward 1 item from table A and up to 3 common consumables or 1 uncommon consumable, for a 2-hour tier 1 salvage adventure) and reward those at the end of a Salvage Mission adventure? If not, can that be put as a request? Or Salvage Mission adventures should be treated as giving no reward at all anymore?"

No answer yet.
