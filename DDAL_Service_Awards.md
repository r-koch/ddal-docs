# D&D® Adventurers League Service Awards

**Effective Date: Oct. 5, 2023 to Jan. 31, 2024. Season: 12C.**

## What is this?

This document provides you with information on rewards you may earn for performing various activities within the D&D Adventurers League campaigns that go beyond participation as a player. All characters attached to the Forgotten Realms, Eberron, Ravenloft, and Dragonlance campaigns are eligible to receive rewards from those listed.

Companions to this document include the **D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide**, the **D&D Adventurers League DM's Guide** and the **D&D Adventurers League FAQ**.

## Types of Service

The following types of service are eligible for rewards. Where applicable, time of 30 minutes or more should be rounded up to the nearest hour.

- Dungeon Mastering
- Using safety tools while Dungeon Mastering
- Running games with new players
- Mentoring new Dungeon Masters
- Reviewing DMsGuild adventures
- Event organization
- Event staffing
- Running a learn-to-play event
- Creating event code of conduct
- Streamed game participation and production

***Dungeon Mastering.*** This is the act of Dungeon Mastering a D&D Adventurers League adventure or session. Each hour you Dungeon Master counts towards your rewards (prep time included). You may accumulate time from session to session.

***Using Safety Tools.*** If you use safety tools while Dungeon Mastering, you may add one hour for every four hours to your total time spent Dungeon Mastering for purposes of accumulating time for rewards.

***Running New Players.*** If you run a game ("Dungeon Mastering," "Mentoring New DMs," "Event Organization," "Running Learn-to-Play," "Streaming Games") with new players add one hour for every first-time Adventurers League player in the session.

***Mentoring New DMs.*** If you mentor a new Dungeon Master at a session, you earn time towards rewards as if you had Dungeon Mastered for the hours spent mentoring.

***Reviewing DMsGuild Adventures.*** You earn one hour of time per two reviews written for adventures on DMsGuild.

***Running Learn-to-Play.*** You earn time for running learn-to-play games (either as a Dungeon Master or staff member) at a rate of one hour for every two hours of time spent during learn-to-play.

***Create a Code of Conduct.*** If you contributed to the creation of your event's code of conduct, you earn one reward per unique event code of conduct created. An event series or recurring event only counts once for this award.

***Streamed Games.*** If you participated as a producer of a streamed or podcasted D&D Adventurers League game, you earn time towards rewards equal to double the time of the streamed session. If you participated as a Dungeon Master or player in a streamed session, you earn time equal to the time of the streamed session or streamed Dungeon Master prep.

***Event Organization.*** This is the act of setting up and managing multiple tables of play. You earn one reward per day of a public event, or instance of a public event if the event is less than a day long. You must organize an event with a minimum of two tables of play (usually at least eight players and two Dungeon Masters) to qualify for this reward.

***Event Staffing.*** This is the act of assisting event organizers in organizing duties, excluding Dungeon Mastering. You earn one reward per day of a public event, or instance of a public event if the event is less than a day long. You must be a staff member for an event with a minimum of 20 players to qualify for this award.

> ### Rewards Stack
>
> The rewards above can be stacked together if you're performing multiple services at the same time. For example, Dungeon Mastering a streamed learn-to-play D&D Adventurers League game with safety tools for four hours is worth 11 hours towards your rewards (four for DMing, four for stream participation, two for learn-to-play, one for safety tools).

### Assigning Rewards

Each reward must be assigned to a specific character. Once a magic item reward is earned, it cannot be earned again for this reporting period. If you do not have a character that you'd like to receive the award, it is lost. As a reminder, characters are not limited by the number of magic items they can possess, only the number they may carry when beginning play of an adventure or session.

You must record rewards assigned to a character on your character's logsheet and clearly identify the source of the reward. If a player's choice reward (blank reward) is restricted to a campaign setting, the character it is assigned to must match that campaign setting.

### On your Honor

You are responsible for tracking your rewards. Keep an accurate log of your service hours and activities; record your hours as soon as you can after the service and make your selections as appropriate.

You may choose to wait to select your rewards, but all rewards for this reporting period must be earned by January 31 2024. You should choose and assign your rewards before performing any service for the next reporting period. If a new Service Awards document is not available on Feb 1st 2024, you may continue to use this or start saving hours for the next Service Awards document.
