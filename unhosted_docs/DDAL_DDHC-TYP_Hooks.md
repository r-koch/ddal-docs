# Tales from the Yawning Portal Hooks

The dungeon crawls presented in Tales from the Yawning Portal are by and large taken from older content and updated to the 5th edition of the rules. There are hints of Greyhawk and other campaign worlds contained therein, but the Adventurers League content takes place in the Forgotten Realms. To that end, the admin team assembled a series of "Hooks" articles to get players excited about the adventures that lay before them.

These hooks are not required, but you may find them very helpful – they even include some handy DM guidance!

## The Sunless Citadel

Old Durnan stood behind the bar of the Yawning Portal, as he always did; it was commonly thought that the sardonic old man simply chose the drudgery of maintaining the day-to-day operations of the bar in order to save a few silver and not hire more employees. He scowled a bit, chewed thoughtfully on his lip, and topped off my flagon with my third mug of Sleeping Dragon Dark after I fished out my fourth and fifth battered toal and dropped it in his tipping stein.

"Sure, why not?" he growled out as he slammed the mug down in front of me. "Your money's only as good as the old dwarf's information, I suppose. No sense keep your coin if you're not gonna come back after you hear this."

The tale he proceeded to tell me was worth every bit of that toal, let me tell you.

---

*"The old dwarf only had one eye, but it had all the madness of an entire clan, I tell you. He babbled about enchanted fruit and a strange druid, but more interestingly he spoke of a subterranean fortress that was near Neverwinter but nobody seemed to know about.*

*But that isn't what grabbed me.*

*This strange druid was his friend, his ally; his reason for only having one eye but he wouldn't speak of that. Only of "the apple, the bright red apple" and the betrayal that followed. His druid buddy led them all from Neverwinter and into this place, this so-called "Sunless Citadel" – not a great name for a subterranean fortress; not very imaginative, right? – and one by one they were picked off by kobolds and goblins and poisoned traps but they just pressed on. And on. And on.*

*The dwarf wasn't very descriptive, but drove it home that they were in the fortress a good long while.*

*His eye lit up with passion and excitement when he spoke what they ultimately found, but even for me it's a stretch. A tree, he said – well, drooled, really, as he was already a good fifteen pints in of my best batch – a tree full of apples. Underground. But full of apples.*

*From there he kind of trailed off but what I still think about is the glint of malice in his eye when he spoke about the people he met in Thundertree after the druid poked out his peeper and he fled the citadel. Talgen, Sharwyn, and Karakas, he called them, and they were poor fools; he almost seemed gleeful that he was sending these children into the dark for a what was sure to be a tall tale – or worse. His steely gaze haunts me still.*

*Thanks to the city guard the old dwarf has since moved on, but his posture and language when he spoke about those young, bright-eyed adventurers… chilling.*

*Tell you what: take your gold back. You've got a strong arm and sharp mind, and I'm reasonably confident that you have capable allies lurking around here somewhere. Use those coins to book passage north and get to Thundertree. Get those kids home.*

*Just don't tell anyone that I went soft for a minute here."*

Incredulously, I took my coins back. It wasn't much, but enough to get my friends and myself north to the village of Thundertree. From what Durnan said I had no choice but to believe him that the dwarf was long gone, likely off to sow chaos and discord and more tall tales but if these over-eager kids had gotten themselves into danger it would only be right to look into it.

… right?

We made it to Thundertree in five days thanks to a fast keelboat in Waterdeep and fine horses in Neverwinter. The good people of Thundertree didn't know much about any underground fortress, but they told us about a lifeless area just a bit north and west of the village and near the foothills of Mount Hotenow. Apparently those young adventurers spoke loudly about their expedition to that area but Talgen and Shawryn are the children of a local merchant who has offered a fine reward for their safe return. It's been a month and then some, but I have hope.

We aim to set out in the morning.

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- the Sunless Citadel is nestled in the foothills just south of Mount Hotenow, near the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast in Faerun
- exchange the references to Oakhurst to Thundertree, a village near Neverwinter
- Shatterspike, an item that can be found in this adventure CANNOT be used to destroy magic items. Looks for this in the next update to the FAQ.
- maps [can be purchased directly](http://prints.mikeschley.com/p185850026) from Mike Schley's website
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 1, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 1-4 (tier 1)
- Meepo. SO MUCH MEEPO. This kobold can be used as a bridge or hook into Forge of Fury, the next chapter in Tales from the Yawning Portal.
- There are some great roleplaying opportunities for the NPCs in the adventure; read page 31 very carefully!

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5′ square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - play the kobolds as cowardly and prone to running or screaming for their friends
- change up the traps using the DMG as guidance, especially if people are re-playing the adventure

## The Forge of Fury

This article assumes that the characters are not using [DDAL0601 A Thousand Tiny Deaths](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/209228/DDAL0601-A-Thousand-Tiny-Deaths-5e) as their hook into the Forge of Fury adventure. Although that adventure is the intended path to get characters involved, the following text can serve as a secondary route to get them here!

---

*"The dwarves were boisterous in their celebrations. Young and away from their clans for perhaps the first time in their lives, these earth-dwellers had yet to grow out their full and glorious beards, yet their bravado more than made up for the lack of actual experience. They spun glorious tales of drink and dance, of battle and blood – or was it bloody drinks and dance battles? I cannot rightly recall.*

*BUT!*

*They were grand in their ambitions!"*

The brightly-dressed gnome took a grand swing from his draught as Durnan coughed and rolled his eyes. Apparently this wasn't the first time that the surly bartender had heard the tiny bard spin this particular tale.

*"Durgeddin the Black – as dwarfy a name as I've ever heard – long ago established the hold of Khundrukar below the Spine of the World, far to the north. Too cold for most of us and too far underground for the rest, the dwarves established their citadel in the one place that they felt their sworn enemies (those stinking, vile orcs) wouldn't look… under a rocky hill called 'The Stone Tooth'. They named it thusly, it is said, because it looks like a broken orc tusk jutting from the earth – and really, why would dwarves live in the vicinity of such orcish glory?"*

He chuckled to himself, loosed a cabbage-smelling belch, and continued unabated:

*"Durgeddin was a master smith, and his people took up as his apprentices out of need for goods and a glut of resources for trade. For many years the place churned out exquisite blades and implements of prestigious power… but with that power comes recognition, and with recognition comes enmity, and who better to loathe the dwarves than their age-old foes the orc tribes? The orcs sieged the smiths for months. 'The Smith's War', or 'Durdeggin's Vengeance' as some called it, was a bloody and protracted battle. Much blood was shed, very sad; everyone lost.*

*Except the orcs, I suppose. They eventually breached the dwarfhold and looted with abandon. Drove the craftsmen out, stole everything they'd made. And why? Blood and glory, I suppose. Agents of chaos, those orcs, or Mrykul or Bane or Mask, who knows? Down to the stones they cleaned the place and this was decades ago – just imagine what has moved in now that those dwarves have been hunted to extinction.*

*Imagine what the orcs missed.*

*… imagine what the dwarves would pay to have their honor and clan holdings restored!"*

Durnan looked at me plainly as I realized well after he did that my mug was empty. "Look, I'll fill your mug if you just buy one of his maps and get him out of here" he growled as he pushed over a sloshing, frothy brew of something he generally referred to as 'the good stuff', and I plunked three toal in front of the rainbow-clad gnome. In return, the bard handed me a folded and dirty piece of parchment showing Luskan and Mirabar.

*"The Forge of Fury, they call it now. It's somewhere northwest of Mirabar – look for the village of Blasingdell. Little place. Great food. Horrible tippers."* He looked at me expectantly, his hand outstretched. Sighing, I placed two more toal in his grubby palm.

He beamed brightly and added: *"Did you know that the dwarves have cousins covered in spines and that have a penchant for poison? Duergar. Nasty little buggers. Might want to go prepared!"* These words garnered the attention of a table full of spiky-haired, dusky-skinned dwarves; Durnan swatted at the gnome and jerked his thumb towards the door.

As the colorful gnome scurried out, dodging the glares of what I only assumed to be the duergar sitting across the room, I couldn't help but wonder… what WOULD those dwarves offer to have their lands restored? Maybe a trip to Blasingdell wouldn't be out of the question. I mean, that last excursion Durnan pointed me towards worked out pretty well.

Tales from the Yawning Portal, indeed. Might just make a career out of this!

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- The Forge of Fury is near the mining village of Blasingdell, just north and west of Mirabar near the Sword Coast in Faerun.
- While Blasingdell is not indicated on the above map, it should be placed along the trade roads that leave Mirabar north or northwest
- Blasingdell (and Mirabar) is primarily comprised of humans and dwarves; as such, worship of Moradin, Gorm, and Vergadain wouldn't be out of place here
- Baron Althon, a noble that works with the characters, works best if presented as a descendant of Durgeddin, or at least as a blacksmith that made his (or her!) fortune studying dwarven craftsmanship techniques (specifically those of Durgeddin). Give him or her a little backstory and this NPC will become a vibrant part of the adventure experience for your characters
- The characters are under no obligation to sell the magical items at the end of the adventure, though they are free to do so – this is one of the few times that magic items can be sold for gold pieces;  the Baron will also purchase the handaxe and warhammer is the characters wish to sell
- Be sure to brush up on the suffocation rules from the DMG
- this is likely to be the first time that the characters enter an underground complex – are they using lights? darkvision is only black & white, so this might change how you describe some rooms and areas
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 3, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 1-4 (tier 1)
- remember that permanent magic items can be used while playing an adventure and only need to be assigned to characters (and thereby increase that character's permanent magic item count) at the conclusion of the adventure
- the ghost of the dwarf may be insane, but what does it say? how does it act? what if the characters attempt to interact with it?
- the *ring* has nothing stored inside of it
- There are some great roleplaying opportunities for the NPCs in the adventure; read page 31 very carefully!
    
Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5' square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - adjust spell lists based on in-game events: did the sentries sound an alarm or destroy the bridge? (etc)
  - be ready to run the Mountain Door Defenses sidebar and adjust as needed (see the note about spell lists)
- it's been said that troglodytes just LOVE to wrestle people prone and shove their heads underwater…
- encourage roleplaying where possible and appropriate – the orc sentries provide a great set of circumstances for the characters to interact with
- the inscriptions around Khundrukar are written in dwarvish, but do they have some duergar flair? have the orcs left any graffiti on top of the dwarvish runes?
- what was the mysterious project? was it perhaps something in relation to the next adventure, [The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan](https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Yawning-Portal-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/0786966092/)? or perhaps related to [DDAL05-08 Durlag's Tower](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/199490/DDAL0508-Durlags-Tower-5e) & [DDAL05-09 Durlag's Tomb](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/199491/DDAL0509-Durlags-Tomb-5e)? delve into the history of the dwarves and have some fun with it!
- the characters may find some lore or maps indicating other adventure sites if they search area 49. What will they find? is it related to the above bullet point?
- Idalla can become a returning antagonist in later adventures or an erstwhile ally (of sorts). Take note of how the characters interact with this NPC and you may be surprised by the story opportunities that crop up later

## Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan

*"Durnan, the perpetually scowling proprietor of the Yawning Portal Inn, harrumphed as a he pushed his broom sullenly across the floor. He seemed to be muttering something about druids and feathers.*

*As I took my seat at the bar he gave no indication that he would be attending to me any time soon. Instead, a portly half-elf scurried over to the taps and produced a frothy, chilled bronze mug full of the Amnish mead and collected my gold. Sipping the slightly nutty but honeyed drink I surveyed the room; each time I visited this place I heard more and greater tales of heroism and adventure and I truly hoped that today would be no different.*

*Thankfully I had but a few moments to wait. Scanning over and beyond the dirty dwarves and burly orcs, my eyes came to rest on a group of deeply-tanned humans in the corner. They were deeply engaged in not only their stories but also their drinks; a collection of empty mugs had grown on their table and were now threatening to take over and spill to the floor. I winked at my half-elven barkeep friend and indicated that I would like to order 4 more of whatever they were having.*

*The humans blinked in brief confusion as I placed a new mug before each of them. Their language was strange, almost alien, and once they started chatting again it took me a few moments to realize that they were speaking Chultan. The jungle island (or peninsula, to some) far to the south did not often have visitors that I was aware of, and rarer still would the natives leave and come to the mainland – let alone as far north as Waterdeep. I took in their story as best I could, though I'm afraid I lost a little bit in translation.*

*You see, friend, they were speaking of an ancient and nearly forgotten city named Tamoachan. Located somewhere along the interior of the Mistcliffs, the mountains on the northwest side of the island, Chultans of yesteryear had built a shrine dedicated to Zotzilaha. This being's function translated loosely to 'vampire god' – or was it 'death god'?  – and this shrine was built to simultaneously give worship to it and bind it to one place. Only their greatest warriors and shamans would be allowed to trek there, as the entrance was hidden deep below the labyrinthine streets of that place. Great and terrible challenges await in those halls, from poisoned darts to monstrous foes to fearsome servants of the 'vampire god' himself… alas, I am unfit for such a trip!"*

I tapped my recently bandaged ribs and leg, explained that kobolds were to be avoided at all costs, and continued:

*"Though you, my brave and eager friends, are merely a ship's passage away from glory in the dark jungle to the south. Think of it: piles of gold, enchanted ritual daggers and platinum-gilded masks of the animal gods, elder curses and wards… oh how the heart aches for what it cannot have.*

*Come, I will draw you a map of what I understood from their conversation. You should be able to get to Port Nyanzaru on the north side of the island, then in no more than three days journey into the jungle you should find this place and harvest from it the riches that every adventurer craves!"*

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan is located somewhere in Chult, the largely-unexplored jungle to the south of the Sword Coast; be sure to substitute references of "Olman" for "Chultan"
- it's location on Chult is not specified in the adventure text, but because of the level of the adventure it is suggested that it be somewhere near the eastern rim of the Mistcliffs – a few day's journey from Port Nyanzaru but not a full expedition into the heart of the island
- most of Chult's natives are human, but there are goblins, albino dwarves, aaracockra, and even pteramen ("Terror-Men" to the natives; a race that looks to be equal parts humanoid and flying lizard) that live there
- light sources are very important in this adventure – be mindful of the native denizens of the shrine, the length of tunnels, and so on!
- Be sure to brush up on the suffocation rules from the DMG
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 5, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 5-10 (tier 2)
- one trap may cause a character to fall asleep for 5,000 years. be sure to carefully read the functions of the trap, as there are a number of ways to dispel the effect! If all else fails, the characters may be able to bring their sleeping ally back to the nearest town and use downtime for spells.
- Instead of Chult, you may wish to place the Shrine somewhere in the lands that make up the Maztica setting within the Forgotten Realms. There are far fewer hooks between Adventurers League play and these remote lands, but to be fair: Maztica is still in the Forgotten Realms, and completely viable. It's just a HECK of a boat ride away.
- if a character incurs the wrath of Tloques, it can be difficult to adjudicate a visit by the Lord of Outsiders after your game concludes. If these are your regular players, run the encounter as-written in the book – but for Adventurers League play the encounter should be run immediately after the conclusion of the adventure
- the sleeping martial arts adepts can be bribed with uncommon or rarer magic items; however, if a character gives up an item in this manner their permanent magic item does not go down by 1 unless the sacrificed item was found during this play session in Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
- The cursed treasure of Pelota requires a Charisma saving throw (the text only indicates "a saving throw")
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- It is entirely possible to dance until you die due to failed saving throws and exhaustion levels
- **Magic items.**
  - The +2 bronze battleaxe differs from the one printed in the DMG and does not have a specific rarity; as such, it is untradeable.
  - The dried-out potions may be used normally – just add water!
  - The +1 laminated wooden longsword has additional qualities not present in the DMG and does not have a specific rarity; as such, it is untradeable
  - The bracelet of rock magic has some special qualities and limited-use rules; read it carefully!
  - The +1 rusty dagger is not a tradeable item, but if the item breaks the owner's permanent magic item count is reduced by 1
  - Using the eagle whistle is not an action; although you can still move and use bonus actions, if you talk (including the use of verbal spell components) you immediately cease using the whistle
  - Using a mirror of the past requires significant DM interpretation. Be ready to get creative!
  - Cursed items: casting *remove curse* only allows a character to un-attune to an item; it does not allow the curse to be shut down unless the item's text specifically says otherwise

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5′ square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
- remember that the gas inflicts 3 (1d6) poison damage every hour to creatures that are not native inhabitants of the Shrine. This WILL impact how the characters rest and recuperate!
- this place is filled with flavorful traps (and a few very nasty "death traps", to boot!) – keep the suspense high by making the Investigation, Perception, and Sleight of Hand checks for the characters
- remember that traps do not provide experience unless explicitly noted that they do, so be careful when adjusting damage types or imposing disadvantage on search and trap disarm checks
- if this group will be playing through the rest of the dungeons, perhaps consider linking the bracelet of rock magic into Against the Giants in some way
- the Tomb of Pelota can make an awesome little mini-game experience for your players – imagine it as a combination of basketball, racquetball, and soccer (or football for those outside of the United States)
- The themes presented here – as well as the Shrine's location in Chult (now that we've all watched the #StreamOfAnnihilation, right?) – make for excellent groundwork for Tomb of Horrors. How might you link those together?

## White Plume Mountain

This article assumes that the characters are not using [DDAL06-02 The Redemption of Kelvan](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/211249/DDAL0602-The-Redemption-of-Kelvan-5e) as their hook into the White Plume Mountain adventure. Although that adventure is the intended path to get characters involved, the following text can serve as a secondary route to get them here!

---

"There is something about the North, I think."

I read the broadsheet from Neverwinter again. The headline was in large block letters, as plain as the rising sun: River of Blood! The article was sensational and graphic nearly to excess; someone had enacted a plan to turn stain Neverwinter River fully red with blood. Bodies were piled so high along the river bank that they reached the street level in some places, it claimed, and the river rocks will be forever stained.

"Utter garbage", grumbled Durnan. "If y'ask me it was probably just four or six adventurers that ran afoul of the wrong kind of orc grog and fell into the Neverwinter River." He continued cleaning the chipped steins behind the bar and didn't bother to look up.

I kept reading, and once the article had extended off of the front page and into the back sections it discussed the accused. An entourage of nobles, led by Sir Bluto Sans Pite from Luskan, have been accused of slaughtering sailors and peasants alike and tossing their bodies into the river. The article didn't make clear any reason for these actions, though it painted them in a fairly horrible light and included some fairly high-quality sketches of Sir Bluto's face on the back page. Below the sketch could be seen a whole slew of charges, including murder, extortion, escape from prison, dereliction of duty, assault upon a priest of Ilmater, drunkenness, and more. The gold reward was substantial – 10,000 gold pieces!

"Durnan, some people are just mon-" I was interrupted by a pair of visitors that burst through the door, their voices loud and intermingled but all seemingly intent on confronting the grumpy barkeep.

The first, a brightly-dressed Shou trader named Fai Chen dug deep into his pouches while his words, much like his copper and silver coins, spilled out into the room. "DURNAN! Sir, this injustice will not stand!" he bellowed as he slammed a neatly-folded piece of parchment onto the countertop.

Durnan merely raised an eyebrow and continued wiping his steins.

The second, a thickly-scented wizard with a porcelain mask and deep anger in his eyes, presented a note as well. "My old friend", and there was much emphasis on the word friend, "it appears that someone has taken it upon themselves to explore our stocks. The trader and I are in identical circumstances. I would strongly suggest that you examine your trophy case."

At this, Durnan actually gave a start. I don't know that I've seen Durnan look alarmed before, but that certainly washed across his face – he dropped the mug and hurried over to a locked trophy case next to the bar. He gasped, fumbled his keys into the lock, and removed a similarly-folded parchment from one of the shelves. The three of them fell into a hushed conversation and I realized that this was my chance.

Fai Chen's note was still on the bar, and they were not looking in my direction. I gave in to curiosity and stealthily took it. I covertly unfolded it below the bar and read the contents:

*Search ye far or search ye near*  
*You'll find no trace of the three*  
*Unless you follow instructions clear*  
*For the weapons abide with me.*

*North past forest, farm and furrow*  
*You must go to the feathered mound*  
*Then down away from the sun you'll burrow*  
*Forget life, forget light, forget sound.*

*To rescue Wave, you must do battle*  
*With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble*  
*Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle*  
*Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double*

*Blackrazor yet remains to be won*  
*Underneath inverted ziggurat.*  
*That garnered, think not that you're done*  
*For now you'll find you are caught*

*I care not, former owners brave*  
*What heroes you seek to hire.*  
*Through might, I'll make each one my slave*  
*Or send him to the fire.*

As I completed my read, the trader paused in his barrage of whispers and cleared his throat. "Feathered mound? You don't think… there was that fortress that recently appeared, as if constructed overnight by magic…"

The wizard interjected: "Keraptis. Damn him. He can't be allowed to keep those artifacts; they're simply too powerful and that's why they were separated."

The three shared a look, then as one swiveled to look at me (why the Yawning Portal was empty was a mystery to me; it was mid-day after all). Durnan maintained eye contact as he walked towards me. "You. You there! You look like the adventuring type – you want to make a massive pile of coins, right? Earn a few potential favors from my allies and me? Listen up…"

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- White Plume Mountain is most easily inserted into the Forgotten Realms near Neverwinter; it requires very little narrative revision to place it near to or even inside of Mount Hotenow
- For Adventurers League purposes, Wave, Whelm, and Blackrazor are owned by Durnan, Fai Chen, and Rastol Shan (the masked wizard above)
- the Mountain refers to a small village near the mountain; you could use Thundertree (and thereby link back to The Sunless Citadel) or create a tiny logging village of 20 residents near the base of the mountain
- Keraptis is from another D&D campaign setting: Greyhawk. Why he and his mountain-fortress has been transported to the Forgotten Realms is outside the bounds of the adventure, but he desires these items because he feels that he can use them to return home
- spell effects like lightning bolt and fireball may have dire consequences in some areas
- Sir Bluto Sans Pite and his minions should be from Neverwinter, Waterdeep, or some other suitably large location. They are not undead, but their faces may be recognizable (see the narrative text above) due to his involvement in the River of Blood mass murder case
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 8, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 5-10 (tier 2)
- if the characters are considered to be 'very weak', remove one efreet from the end of the adventure. Conversely, if the characters are 'strong' or 'very strong', add 1 or 2 additional efreet as per the adventure text. Nobody knows your table better than you do, so be sure to challenge the characters without going overboard!
- if the adventure runs long for your adventurers, you may wish to have the characters return to town after liberating each of the artifacts. refer to the FAQ for details on the rewards that are offered, as these rewards may help the characters more easily complete the remaining section(s) of the dungeon.
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- **Magic items.**
  - *Wave*, *Whelm*, and *Blackrazor* may be used while the characters are still inside of White Plume Mountain. Once the characters leave – for any reason – the items must be surrendered as per the adventure text and the Adventurers League FAQ. Any character that chooses to retain one or more of these items is immediately retired from Adventurers League play. Refer to the FAQ for the full ruling on these items.
  - "Pet" golems discovered within the White Plume Mountain are mystically enchanted to stay within the confines of this place. Not even a wish can overcome this effect.
  - The ring with "many powers" (avoiding spoilers) only has these magical abilities while in the one room, and does not count as a permanent magic item – this does mean that it is neither considered tradeable nor consumable. If any of the rings powers indicate that concentration is needed, as soon as the bearer leaves the room the spell ends.

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10' squares instead of the normal 5' square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
- White Plume Mountain is a classic adventure, and many players may have already experienced it. Feel free to adjust traps and other thematic elements, such as changing the gynosphinx's riddle in the beginning to another riddle of your choosing
- consider using a stopwatch during the timed elements
- many of the rooms in this complex work well if you evoke a "pulp" feeling – the heroics should be larger-than-life!
- if your characters are extremely combat efficient, you may wish to either increase the frequency of the random encounters or give them a slight adjustment by adding an extra creature, mixing in a trap from the DMG or the glyph spell from the PHB, or even rolling every 10 minutes of actual play time (instead of time spent in-game)
- although Keraptis is from another world, there may be consequences for the characters if they defeat him but do not destroy him. Surely, they will have marked themselves as powerful foes of a very powerful wizard…
