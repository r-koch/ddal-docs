# Tales from the Yawning Portal Hooks

The dungeon crawls presented in Tales from the Yawning Portal are by and large taken from older content and updated to the 5th edition of the rules. There are hints of Greyhawk and other campaign worlds contained therein, but the Adventurers League content takes place in the Forgotten Realms. To that end, the admin team assembled a series of "Hooks" articles to get players excited about the adventures that lay before them.

## The Sunless Citadel

Old Durnan stood behind the bar of the Yawning Portal, as he always did; it was commonly thought that the sardonic old man simply chose the drudgery of maintaining the day-to-day operations of the bar in order to save a few silver and not hire more employees. He scowled a bit, chewed thoughtfully on his lip, and topped off my flagon with my third mug of Sleeping Dragon Dark after I fished out my fourth and fifth battered toal and dropped it in his tipping stein.

"Sure, why not?" he growled out as he slammed the mug down in front of me. "Your money's only as good as the old dwarf's information, I suppose. No sense keep your coin if you're not gonna come back after you hear this."

The tale he proceeded to tell me was worth every bit of that toal, let me tell you.

---

*"The old dwarf only had one eye, but it had all the madness of an entire clan, I tell you. He babbled about enchanted fruit and a strange druid, but more interestingly he spoke of a subterranean fortress that was near Neverwinter but nobody seemed to know about.*

*But that isn't what grabbed me.*

*This strange druid was his friend, his ally; his reason for only having one eye but he wouldn't speak of that. Only of "the apple, the bright red apple" and the betrayal that followed. His druid buddy led them all from Neverwinter and into this place, this so-called "Sunless Citadel" – not a great name for a subterranean fortress; not very imaginative, right? – and one by one they were picked off by kobolds and goblins and poisoned traps but they just pressed on. And on. And on.*

*The dwarf wasn't very descriptive, but drove it home that they were in the fortress a good long while.*

*His eye lit up with passion and excitement when he spoke what they ultimately found, but even for me it's a stretch. A tree, he said – well, drooled, really, as he was already a good fifteen pints in of my best batch – a tree full of apples. Underground. But full of apples.*

*From there he kind of trailed off but what I still think about is the glint of malice in his eye when he spoke about the people he met in Thundertree after the druid poked out his peeper and he fled the citadel. Talgen, Sharwyn, and Karakas, he called them, and they were poor fools; he almost seemed gleeful that he was sending these children into the dark for a what was sure to be a tall tale – or worse. His steely gaze haunts me still.*

*Thanks to the city guard the old dwarf has since moved on, but his posture and language when he spoke about those young, bright-eyed adventurers… chilling.*

*Tell you what: take your gold back. You've got a strong arm and sharp mind, and I'm reasonably confident that you have capable allies lurking around here somewhere. Use those coins to book passage north and get to Thundertree. Get those kids home.*

*Just don't tell anyone that I went soft for a minute here."*

Incredulously, I took my coins back. It wasn't much, but enough to get my friends and myself north to the village of Thundertree. From what Durnan said I had no choice but to believe him that the dwarf was long gone, likely off to sow chaos and discord and more tall tales but if these over-eager kids had gotten themselves into danger it would only be right to look into it.

… right?

We made it to Thundertree in five days thanks to a fast keelboat in Waterdeep and fine horses in Neverwinter. The good people of Thundertree didn't know much about any underground fortress, but they told us about a lifeless area just a bit north and west of the village and near the foothills of Mount Hotenow. Apparently those young adventurers spoke loudly about their expedition to that area but Talgen and Shawryn are the children of a local merchant who has offered a fine reward for their safe return. It's been a month and then some, but I have hope.

We aim to set out in the morning.

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- the Sunless Citadel is nestled in the foothills just south of Mount Hotenow, near the city of Neverwinter on the Sword Coast in Faerun
- exchange the references to Oakhurst to Thundertree, a village near Neverwinter
- Shatterspike, an item that can be found in this adventure CANNOT be used to destroy magic items. Looks for this in the next update to the FAQ.
- maps [can be purchased directly](http://prints.mikeschley.com/p185850026) from Mike Schley's website
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 1, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 1-4 (tier 1)
- Meepo. SO MUCH MEEPO. This kobold can be used as a bridge or hook into Forge of Fury, the next chapter in Tales from the Yawning Portal.
- There are some great roleplaying opportunities for the NPCs in the adventure; read page 31 very carefully!

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5′ square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - play the kobolds as cowardly and prone to running or screaming for their friends
- change up the traps using the DMG as guidance, especially if people are re-playing the adventure

## The Forge of Fury

This article assumes that the characters are not using [DDAL0601 A Thousand Tiny Deaths](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/209228/DDAL0601-A-Thousand-Tiny-Deaths-5e) as their hook into the Forge of Fury adventure. Although that adventure is the intended path to get characters involved, the following text can serve as a secondary route to get them here!

---

*"The dwarves were boisterous in their celebrations. Young and away from their clans for perhaps the first time in their lives, these earth-dwellers had yet to grow out their full and glorious beards, yet their bravado more than made up for the lack of actual experience. They spun glorious tales of drink and dance, of battle and blood – or was it bloody drinks and dance battles? I cannot rightly recall.*

*BUT!*

*They were grand in their ambitions!"*

The brightly-dressed gnome took a grand swing from his draught as Durnan coughed and rolled his eyes. Apparently this wasn't the first time that the surly bartender had heard the tiny bard spin this particular tale.

*"Durgeddin the Black – as dwarfy a name as I've ever heard – long ago established the hold of Khundrukar below the Spine of the World, far to the north. Too cold for most of us and too far underground for the rest, the dwarves established their citadel in the one place that they felt their sworn enemies (those stinking, vile orcs) wouldn't look… under a rocky hill called 'The Stone Tooth'. They named it thusly, it is said, because it looks like a broken orc tusk jutting from the earth – and really, why would dwarves live in the vicinity of such orcish glory?"*

He chuckled to himself, loosed a cabbage-smelling belch, and continued unabated:

*"Durgeddin was a master smith, and his people took up as his apprentices out of need for goods and a glut of resources for trade. For many years the place churned out exquisite blades and implements of prestigious power… but with that power comes recognition, and with recognition comes enmity, and who better to loathe the dwarves than their age-old foes the orc tribes? The orcs sieged the smiths for months. 'The Smith's War', or 'Durdeggin's Vengeance' as some called it, was a bloody and protracted battle. Much blood was shed, very sad; everyone lost.*

*Except the orcs, I suppose. They eventually breached the dwarfhold and looted with abandon. Drove the craftsmen out, stole everything they'd made. And why? Blood and glory, I suppose. Agents of chaos, those orcs, or Mrykul or Bane or Mask, who knows? Down to the stones they cleaned the place and this was decades ago – just imagine what has moved in now that those dwarves have been hunted to extinction.*

*Imagine what the orcs missed.*

*… imagine what the dwarves would pay to have their honor and clan holdings restored!"*

Durnan looked at me plainly as I realized well after he did that my mug was empty. "Look, I'll fill your mug if you just buy one of his maps and get him out of here" he growled as he pushed over a sloshing, frothy brew of something he generally referred to as 'the good stuff', and I plunked three toal in front of the rainbow-clad gnome. In return, the bard handed me a folded and dirty piece of parchment showing Luskan and Mirabar.

*"The Forge of Fury, they call it now. It's somewhere northwest of Mirabar – look for the village of Blasingdell. Little place. Great food. Horrible tippers."* He looked at me expectantly, his hand outstretched. Sighing, I placed two more toal in his grubby palm.

He beamed brightly and added: *"Did you know that the dwarves have cousins covered in spines and that have a penchant for poison? Duergar. Nasty little buggers. Might want to go prepared!"* These words garnered the attention of a table full of spiky-haired, dusky-skinned dwarves; Durnan swatted at the gnome and jerked his thumb towards the door.

As the colorful gnome scurried out, dodging the glares of what I only assumed to be the duergar sitting across the room, I couldn't help but wonder… what WOULD those dwarves offer to have their lands restored? Maybe a trip to Blasingdell wouldn't be out of the question. I mean, that last excursion Durnan pointed me towards worked out pretty well.

Tales from the Yawning Portal, indeed. Might just make a career out of this!

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- The Forge of Fury is near the mining village of Blasingdell, just north and west of Mirabar near the Sword Coast in Faerun.
- While Blasingdell is not indicated on the above map, it should be placed along the trade roads that leave Mirabar north or northwest
- Blasingdell (and Mirabar) is primarily comprised of humans and dwarves; as such, worship of Moradin, Gorm, and Vergadain wouldn't be out of place here
- Baron Althon, a noble that works with the characters, works best if presented as a descendant of Durgeddin, or at least as a blacksmith that made his (or her!) fortune studying dwarven craftsmanship techniques (specifically those of Durgeddin). Give him or her a little backstory and this NPC will become a vibrant part of the adventure experience for your characters
- The characters are under no obligation to sell the magical items at the end of the adventure, though they are free to do so – this is one of the few times that magic items can be sold for gold pieces;  the Baron will also purchase the handaxe and warhammer is the characters wish to sell
- Be sure to brush up on the suffocation rules from the DMG
- this is likely to be the first time that the characters enter an underground complex – are they using lights? darkvision is only black & white, so this might change how you describe some rooms and areas
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 3, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 1-4 (tier 1)
- remember that permanent magic items can be used while playing an adventure and only need to be assigned to characters (and thereby increase that character's permanent magic item count) at the conclusion of the adventure
- the ghost of the dwarf may be insane, but what does it say? how does it act? what if the characters attempt to interact with it?
- the *ring* has nothing stored inside of it
- There are some great roleplaying opportunities for the NPCs in the adventure; read page 31 very carefully!
    
Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5' square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - adjust spell lists based on in-game events: did the sentries sound an alarm or destroy the bridge? (etc)
  - be ready to run the Mountain Door Defenses sidebar and adjust as needed (see the note about spell lists)
- it's been said that troglodytes just LOVE to wrestle people prone and shove their heads underwater…
- encourage roleplaying where possible and appropriate – the orc sentries provide a great set of circumstances for the characters to interact with
- the inscriptions around Khundrukar are written in dwarvish, but do they have some duergar flair? have the orcs left any graffiti on top of the dwarvish runes?
- what was the mysterious project? was it perhaps something in relation to the next adventure, [The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan](https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Yawning-Portal-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/0786966092/)? or perhaps related to [DDAL05-08 Durlag's Tower](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/199490/DDAL0508-Durlags-Tower-5e) & [DDAL05-09 Durlag's Tomb](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/199491/DDAL0509-Durlags-Tomb-5e)? delve into the history of the dwarves and have some fun with it!
- the characters may find some lore or maps indicating other adventure sites if they search area 49. What will they find? is it related to the above bullet point?
- Idalla can become a returning antagonist in later adventures or an erstwhile ally (of sorts). Take note of how the characters interact with this NPC and you may be surprised by the story opportunities that crop up later

## Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan

*"Durnan, the perpetually scowling proprietor of the Yawning Portal Inn, harrumphed as a he pushed his broom sullenly across the floor. He seemed to be muttering something about druids and feathers.*

*As I took my seat at the bar he gave no indication that he would be attending to me any time soon. Instead, a portly half-elf scurried over to the taps and produced a frothy, chilled bronze mug full of the Amnish mead and collected my gold. Sipping the slightly nutty but honeyed drink I surveyed the room; each time I visited this place I heard more and greater tales of heroism and adventure and I truly hoped that today would be no different.*

*Thankfully I had but a few moments to wait. Scanning over and beyond the dirty dwarves and burly orcs, my eyes came to rest on a group of deeply-tanned humans in the corner. They were deeply engaged in not only their stories but also their drinks; a collection of empty mugs had grown on their table and were now threatening to take over and spill to the floor. I winked at my half-elven barkeep friend and indicated that I would like to order 4 more of whatever they were having.*

*The humans blinked in brief confusion as I placed a new mug before each of them. Their language was strange, almost alien, and once they started chatting again it took me a few moments to realize that they were speaking Chultan. The jungle island (or peninsula, to some) far to the south did not often have visitors that I was aware of, and rarer still would the natives leave and come to the mainland – let alone as far north as Waterdeep. I took in their story as best I could, though I'm afraid I lost a little bit in translation.*

*You see, friend, they were speaking of an ancient and nearly forgotten city named Tamoachan. Located somewhere along the interior of the Mistcliffs, the mountains on the northwest side of the island, Chultans of yesteryear had built a shrine dedicated to Zotzilaha. This being's function translated loosely to 'vampire god' – or was it 'death god'?  – and this shrine was built to simultaneously give worship to it and bind it to one place. Only their greatest warriors and shamans would be allowed to trek there, as the entrance was hidden deep below the labyrinthine streets of that place. Great and terrible challenges await in those halls, from poisoned darts to monstrous foes to fearsome servants of the 'vampire god' himself… alas, I am unfit for such a trip!"*

I tapped my recently bandaged ribs and leg, explained that kobolds were to be avoided at all costs, and continued:

*"Though you, my brave and eager friends, are merely a ship's passage away from glory in the dark jungle to the south. Think of it: piles of gold, enchanted ritual daggers and platinum-gilded masks of the animal gods, elder curses and wards… oh how the heart aches for what it cannot have.*

*Come, I will draw you a map of what I understood from their conversation. You should be able to get to Port Nyanzaru on the north side of the island, then in no more than three days journey into the jungle you should find this place and harvest from it the riches that every adventurer craves!"*

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan is located somewhere in Chult, the largely-unexplored jungle to the south of the Sword Coast; be sure to substitute references of "Olman" for "Chultan"
- it's location on Chult is not specified in the adventure text, but because of the level of the adventure it is suggested that it be somewhere near the eastern rim of the Mistcliffs – a few day's journey from Port Nyanzaru but not a full expedition into the heart of the island
- most of Chult's natives are human, but there are goblins, albino dwarves, aaracockra, and even pteramen ("Terror-Men" to the natives; a race that looks to be equal parts humanoid and flying lizard) that live there
- light sources are very important in this adventure – be mindful of the native denizens of the shrine, the length of tunnels, and so on!
- Be sure to brush up on the suffocation rules from the DMG
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 5, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 5-10 (tier 2)
- one trap may cause a character to fall asleep for 5,000 years. be sure to carefully read the functions of the trap, as there are a number of ways to dispel the effect! If all else fails, the characters may be able to bring their sleeping ally back to the nearest town and use downtime for spells.
- Instead of Chult, you may wish to place the Shrine somewhere in the lands that make up the Maztica setting within the Forgotten Realms. There are far fewer hooks between Adventurers League play and these remote lands, but to be fair: Maztica is still in the Forgotten Realms, and completely viable. It's just a HECK of a boat ride away.
- if a character incurs the wrath of Tloques, it can be difficult to adjudicate a visit by the Lord of Outsiders after your game concludes. If these are your regular players, run the encounter as-written in the book – but for Adventurers League play the encounter should be run immediately after the conclusion of the adventure
- the sleeping martial arts adepts can be bribed with uncommon or rarer magic items; however, if a character gives up an item in this manner their permanent magic item does not go down by 1 unless the sacrificed item was found during this play session in Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan
- The cursed treasure of Pelota requires a Charisma saving throw (the text only indicates "a saving throw")
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- It is entirely possible to dance until you die due to failed saving throws and exhaustion levels
- **Magic items.**
  - The +2 bronze battleaxe differs from the one printed in the DMG and does not have a specific rarity; as such, it is untradeable.
  - The dried-out potions may be used normally – just add water!
  - The +1 laminated wooden longsword has additional qualities not present in the DMG and does not have a specific rarity; as such, it is untradeable
  - The bracelet of rock magic has some special qualities and limited-use rules; read it carefully!
  - The +1 rusty dagger is not a tradeable item, but if the item breaks the owner's permanent magic item count is reduced by 1
  - Using the eagle whistle is not an action; although you can still move and use bonus actions, if you talk (including the use of verbal spell components) you immediately cease using the whistle
  - Using a mirror of the past requires significant DM interpretation. Be ready to get creative!
  - Cursed items: casting *remove curse* only allows a character to un-attune to an item; it does not allow the curse to be shut down unless the item's text specifically says otherwise

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5′ square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
- remember that the gas inflicts 3 (1d6) poison damage every hour to creatures that are not native inhabitants of the Shrine. This WILL impact how the characters rest and recuperate!
- this place is filled with flavorful traps (and a few very nasty "death traps", to boot!) – keep the suspense high by making the Investigation, Perception, and Sleight of Hand checks for the characters
- remember that traps do not provide experience unless explicitly noted that they do, so be careful when adjusting damage types or imposing disadvantage on search and trap disarm checks
- if this group will be playing through the rest of the dungeons, perhaps consider linking the bracelet of rock magic into Against the Giants in some way
- the Tomb of Pelota can make an awesome little mini-game experience for your players – imagine it as a combination of basketball, racquetball, and soccer (or football for those outside of the United States)
- The themes presented here – as well as the Shrine's location in Chult (now that we've all watched the #StreamOfAnnihilation, right?) – make for excellent groundwork for Tomb of Horrors. How might you link those together?

## White Plume Mountain

This article assumes that the characters are not using [DDAL06-02 The Redemption of Kelvan](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/211249/DDAL0602-The-Redemption-of-Kelvan-5e) as their hook into the White Plume Mountain adventure. Although that adventure is the intended path to get characters involved, the following text can serve as a secondary route to get them here!

---

"There is something about the North, I think."

I read the broadsheet from Neverwinter again. The headline was in large block letters, as plain as the rising sun: River of Blood! The article was sensational and graphic nearly to excess; someone had enacted a plan to turn stain Neverwinter River fully red with blood. Bodies were piled so high along the river bank that they reached the street level in some places, it claimed, and the river rocks will be forever stained.

"Utter garbage", grumbled Durnan. "If y'ask me it was probably just four or six adventurers that ran afoul of the wrong kind of orc grog and fell into the Neverwinter River." He continued cleaning the chipped steins behind the bar and didn't bother to look up.

I kept reading, and once the article had extended off of the front page and into the back sections it discussed the accused. An entourage of nobles, led by Sir Bluto Sans Pite from Luskan, have been accused of slaughtering sailors and peasants alike and tossing their bodies into the river. The article didn't make clear any reason for these actions, though it painted them in a fairly horrible light and included some fairly high-quality sketches of Sir Bluto's face on the back page. Below the sketch could be seen a whole slew of charges, including murder, extortion, escape from prison, dereliction of duty, assault upon a priest of Ilmater, drunkenness, and more. The gold reward was substantial – 10,000 gold pieces!

"Durnan, some people are just mon-" I was interrupted by a pair of visitors that burst through the door, their voices loud and intermingled but all seemingly intent on confronting the grumpy barkeep.

The first, a brightly-dressed Shou trader named Fai Chen dug deep into his pouches while his words, much like his copper and silver coins, spilled out into the room. "DURNAN! Sir, this injustice will not stand!" he bellowed as he slammed a neatly-folded piece of parchment onto the countertop.

Durnan merely raised an eyebrow and continued wiping his steins.

The second, a thickly-scented wizard with a porcelain mask and deep anger in his eyes, presented a note as well. "My old friend", and there was much emphasis on the word friend, "it appears that someone has taken it upon themselves to explore our stocks. The trader and I are in identical circumstances. I would strongly suggest that you examine your trophy case."

At this, Durnan actually gave a start. I don't know that I've seen Durnan look alarmed before, but that certainly washed across his face – he dropped the mug and hurried over to a locked trophy case next to the bar. He gasped, fumbled his keys into the lock, and removed a similarly-folded parchment from one of the shelves. The three of them fell into a hushed conversation and I realized that this was my chance.

Fai Chen's note was still on the bar, and they were not looking in my direction. I gave in to curiosity and stealthily took it. I covertly unfolded it below the bar and read the contents:

*Search ye far or search ye near*  
*You'll find no trace of the three*  
*Unless you follow instructions clear*  
*For the weapons abide with me.*

*North past forest, farm and furrow*  
*You must go to the feathered mound*  
*Then down away from the sun you'll burrow*  
*Forget life, forget light, forget sound.*

*To rescue Wave, you must do battle*  
*With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble*  
*Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle*  
*Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double*

*Blackrazor yet remains to be won*  
*Underneath inverted ziggurat.*  
*That garnered, think not that you're done*  
*For now you'll find you are caught*

*I care not, former owners brave*  
*What heroes you seek to hire.*  
*Through might, I'll make each one my slave*  
*Or send him to the fire.*

As I completed my read, the trader paused in his barrage of whispers and cleared his throat. "Feathered mound? You don't think… there was that fortress that recently appeared, as if constructed overnight by magic…"

The wizard interjected: "Keraptis. Damn him. He can't be allowed to keep those artifacts; they're simply too powerful and that's why they were separated."

The three shared a look, then as one swiveled to look at me (why the Yawning Portal was empty was a mystery to me; it was mid-day after all). Durnan maintained eye contact as he walked towards me. "You. You there! You look like the adventuring type – you want to make a massive pile of coins, right? Earn a few potential favors from my allies and me? Listen up…"

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- White Plume Mountain is most easily inserted into the Forgotten Realms near Neverwinter; it requires very little narrative revision to place it near to or even inside of Mount Hotenow
- For Adventurers League purposes, Wave, Whelm, and Blackrazor are owned by Durnan, Fai Chen, and Rastol Shan (the masked wizard above)
- the Mountain refers to a small village near the mountain; you could use Thundertree (and thereby link back to The Sunless Citadel) or create a tiny logging village of 20 residents near the base of the mountain
- Keraptis is from another D&D campaign setting: Greyhawk. Why he and his mountain-fortress has been transported to the Forgotten Realms is outside the bounds of the adventure, but he desires these items because he feels that he can use them to return home
- spell effects like lightning bolt and fireball may have dire consequences in some areas
- Sir Bluto Sans Pite and his minions should be from Neverwinter, Waterdeep, or some other suitably large location. They are not undead, but their faces may be recognizable (see the narrative text above) due to his involvement in the River of Blood mass murder case
- this adventure runs best with four characters at level 8, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 5-10 (tier 2)
- if the characters are considered to be 'very weak', remove one efreet from the end of the adventure. Conversely, if the characters are 'strong' or 'very strong', add 1 or 2 additional efreet as per the adventure text. Nobody knows your table better than you do, so be sure to challenge the characters without going overboard!
- if the adventure runs long for your adventurers, you may wish to have the characters return to town after liberating each of the artifacts. refer to the FAQ for details on the rewards that are offered, as these rewards may help the characters more easily complete the remaining section(s) of the dungeon.
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- **Magic items.**
  - *Wave*, *Whelm*, and *Blackrazor* may be used while the characters are still inside of White Plume Mountain. Once the characters leave – for any reason – the items must be surrendered as per the adventure text and the Adventurers League FAQ. Any character that chooses to retain one or more of these items is immediately retired from Adventurers League play. Refer to the FAQ for the full ruling on these items.
  - "Pet" golems discovered within the White Plume Mountain are mystically enchanted to stay within the confines of this place. Not even a wish can overcome this effect.
  - The ring with "many powers" (avoiding spoilers) only has these magical abilities while in the one room, and does not count as a permanent magic item – this does mean that it is neither considered tradeable nor consumable. If any of the rings powers indicate that concentration is needed, as soon as the bearer leaves the room the spell ends.

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10' squares instead of the normal 5' square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
- White Plume Mountain is a classic adventure, and many players may have already experienced it. Feel free to adjust traps and other thematic elements, such as changing the gynosphinx's riddle in the beginning to another riddle of your choosing
- consider using a stopwatch during the timed elements
- many of the rooms in this complex work well if you evoke a "pulp" feeling – the heroics should be larger-than-life!
- if your characters are extremely combat efficient, you may wish to either increase the frequency of the random encounters or give them a slight adjustment by adding an extra creature, mixing in a trap from the DMG or the glyph spell from the PHB, or even rolling every 10 minutes of actual play time (instead of time spent in-game)
- although Keraptis is from another world, there may be consequences for the characters if they defeat him but do not destroy him. Surely, they will have marked themselves as powerful foes of a very powerful wizard…

## Dead in Thay

This world is full of dangers and treasures, stories that are just waiting to be told and legends that want to be created. There are days where the Yawning Portal is home to all of these, and then there are days like this one.

Today, a bald and robed man entered the tavern just prior to lunch time. His face was a mass of scars and his mouth was little more than an angry slash across his face, but his coin was good enough. He threw back pint after pint, giving a toothless grin whenever someone asked him if he wanted food. He wasn't rude, just off-putting in the same way that a shaved cat can be. He would occasionally commit strange, arcane sigils to some scraps of parchment that he kept in his boot cuff as the hours ticked by. Other patrons came and went, and this strange fellow barely seemed to take notice of them at all.

As the evening rolled on and the tavern filled up with its usual complement of rowdy do-gooders, occasional ne'er-do-wells, drunken louts and thrill-seeking young royals the tiefling finally gathered his wits about him. He clambered up on top of his table and produced a small hand-harp from some hidden vest pocket, coughed for attention, and sang an upbeat, energized tune in a voice that could only be described as angelic – if angels could be heard speaking as they rolled head-over-feet down a flight of stairs:

"Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the Thaymount site  
Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the gates of Hell!

Don't you want to know why we keep starting fires?  
It's his desire, It's his desire, It's his desire

Don't you want to know why we keep starting fires?  
It's his desire, It's his desire, It's his desire

Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When they touch, When they assist  
Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When they touch, when they assist  
When we touch

Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When they touch, When they assist  
Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When they touch, when they assist  
When they touch, when they assist

Don't you want to know why we keep starting fires?  
It's his desire, It's his desire

Don't you want to know why we keep starting fires?  
It's his desire, It's his desire

Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When we touch, When they assist  
Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When we touch, when they assist  
When we touch

Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When we touch, When they assist  
Danger! Danger! Lich knowledge!  
When we touch, when they assist  
When we touch, when they assist

No more

Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the Thaymount site!  
Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the Bloodgate!  
Fire in the gates of Hell!"

Upon completion of the tune, the bard averted his gaze and stared once more at the floor. He slowly clambered down from the tabletop and shuffled towards the bar. I didn't quite know what to make of him, and judging by the stunned silence in the room neither did anyone else. After a few moments some scattered applause went up but by and large the patrons chuckled off the event and returned to their conversations.

The bard sidled up next to my stool and slid up to the bar. With little more than a grunt he ordered a mug from Durnan, and as he slurped it down I realized two things: first, that his lips were simply an angry slash made of scars; and second, that he was speaking to me between gurgled swallows.

"You wanna know how I got this face?" he spat it out. I was fairly certain that it didn't matter how I responded because he was just going to tell me anyhow.

"Thayans. Thayan rebels, if you can believe that; there are Red Wizards that don't think the other Red Wizards are Red Wizardly enough. I made the mistake of being in their presence out in Daggerdale – you know, on the River Tesh and west of the Moonsea, and they saw fit to use me for their own purposes. Did you know that some of them hate with such passion that it becomes like music? Like dance.

They have a keep – Bloodgate Keep – and plans to use their nexus of portals to assault Thay itself. Imagine that: Red Wizards seeking to unleash magical hell on other Red Wizards. This won't end will, will it? But the nexus of portals… they said it was the lich's will, that it was divine and blessed, that it was the smartest choice. They said a lot of things, like how this vault of theirs contains phylacteries – a dozen of 'em, maybe more. Even holds the most unholy of them all, and I think you know that I mean Szass Tam himself, dread lord of the Thaymount.

As you might imagine I didn't wish to be there, so I made good my escape when they stopped paying attention to me. At least, I thought it was escape. Turns out that it was planned. A cruel trick, but from Red Wizards it is no surprise. Their leader, Syranna, made it clear that the verbal abuses I suffered for my ‘sins upon music itself' would pale in comparison to what the lich himself has planned for Faerun.

I don't know. I just want to play my harp.

Spot me a drink?"

I plunked down two gold pieces and nodded at Durnan. Daggerdale was a good journey from here, but the possibility of Thayan rebels – and a treasure trove of phylacteries! – was just too juicy to pass up.

I left immediately, but not before accepting that a journey to Daggerdale and potentially into Thay itself might well be the last journey I would ever undertake. Ah well, what good can I do from a bar stool?

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- Unlike the rest of *Tales from the Yawning Portal*, the *Dead in Thay* adventure was part of the 5th Edition playtest and was originally designed to take place near Daggerford (initially, with a very early move to Thay), so no significant modifications from the early text are needed
- this adventure runs best with four or five characters at level 9, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 5-10 (tier 2)
- the Doomvault map is split into 9 sectors, each with a different theme; this provides an easy "jumping off" point if you only have two or three hours of potential playtime with your group each week
- as time is of the essence while inside the Doomvault, be sure to remind the characters of the risks they are taking when they rest or leave the dungeon ("Resting" and "Alert Level", p. 113)
- be sure to carefully review the restrictions on magic use while inside the Doomvault ("Dimensional Barriers", p. 110)
- Red Wizards can speak, see, and sense through any dread warriors that they have created – this can help create some great roleplay moments and scenes with the characters
- the fiendish skulls (p. 152) can bestow curses; these curses last until the character receives a *remove curse* spell
- If a character is raised as soul-bound undead, they are immediately retired from Adventurers League play if they leave the Doomvault. Only by destroying Kazit Gul (and thus, the Doomvault) or receiving a *wish* spell can this effect be ended; not even *true resurrection* can wrest the adventurer's soul from Szass Tam's terrible grasp
- **'reduced threat creatures'.** be sure to read this section on p.113 carefully!
- **Random encounters.** This adventure has the potential for a lot of random encounters. It would be helpful to pregenerate a dozen or so of these encounters so that when they happen, play is not interrupted and you can quickly deploy the encounter for the characters.
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- **Magic items.**
  - Despite the suggestion on p. 115, magic items cannot be added to creatures, encounters, or rooms unless the adventure specifically states that such an object exists here. Dread Warriors carry javelins or melee weapons (simple or martial) as their ‘+1 weapon' unless specifically noted otherwise.
  - This adventure can potentially give a large number of *spell scrolls* to the characters – it's a great chance to stock up on utility spells like *detect magic* and *comprehend languages*, which are useful at all levels of play
  - Lahnis wears a *ring of protection* and is very reluctant to get rid of it. If the characters have earned his trust, he might be convinced to turn it over – this is DM's prerogative, though.
  - *Ooze prods* are not considered to be permanent magical items for the purposes of D&D Adventurers League play
- **Cursed items.** Cursed items are a part of D&D history and often serve a purpose in the story. However, some players might be disappointed and view this as a ‘gotcha' moment – tread carefully. Unless the item's description specifically states otherwise, the characters can cast identify on it (or use a downtime spellcasting activity!) and learn the item's properties, including the curse. Once a cursed item is taken by a character and recorded on their logsheet, a *remove curse* spell only removes the attunement ("de-attunes" from the character) and does not undo the curse.

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - increase the size of the maps to 10′ squares instead of the normal 5′ square
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
- the Doomvault is a powerful location in the Thayan political structure. What happens if the characters perform certain acts here? How will this affect your other Adventurers League games (such as the motivations of the Zulkir that is visiting Mulmaster)?
- some of the other creatures in the Doomvault seek to accomplish similar goals and tasks as the characters – perhaps this is a chance to turn enemies into erstwhile allies. Roleplay, as far as they eye can see!
- prior to beginning play, consider asking your players if their chosen characters have peacefully interacted with Red Wizards in the past (Hoard of the Dragon Queen, Rise of Tiamat, and several season 2 adventures provide opportunities for this – as well as others!)
- if a character has chosen to be raised as soul-bound undead, are they aware of the ramifications of leaving the Doomvault? Make sure that they know that playing an adventure other than Dead in Thay between sessions counts as ‘leaving the Doomvault'!

## Against the Giants

I limped away from the cloud of dust and debris that had formerly been a Thayan stronghold, and for what felt like the millionth time I assured myself that I would never again interfere in the affairs of the dread Red Wizards. Their Doomvault was gone and yet somehow I knew that no amount of therapy (short of, perhaps, a potent *remove curse* spell from a friendly wizard) would ever erase those memories from my mind.

Little did I know that that my next adventure was much closer than I expected.

Not even a full tenday after my horrific ordeal I would hear opportunity knocking upon my door once more. I had slumped into a somewhat-soggy and oversized chair in the Laughing Goblin in Phlan when I overheard a group of Zhentish mercenaries loudly calling out to each other with what they would do with "the giant's loot". I listened intently – we all did, really, as the Zhents were thoroughly inebriated and were making no indication of hiding this information – as they spoke in great (if slurred) detail about the steading of the Hill Giant Chief, and how they would be striking out along the road in the morning. The halls of the giants were nestled in the Galena Mountains, which were visible along the horizon far to the east.

The group of hooligans and thugs eventually succumbed to the drink and passed out, and only a few moments passed before I felt the point of a dagger at my ribs and heard a gruff "Dove, you will come with me if you want to survive to see the dawn."

I know Harper code when I hear it, and I know many of the operatives in that esteemed organization. Those Who Harp are not as secret as they pretend to be, but this musky half-orc was new to me. Whether he was indeed a Harper or simply pretending I could not be certain, but he introduced himself and ushered me outside where he hurriedly assembled gear on his horse while explaining that the giants had "significant plans" underway and that there was "a dangerous game to play". He grinned at first, but that became a scowl when he realized that I had not made any indication of taking to horseback myself.

After a long moment of locked eyes and cocked eyebrows, he grunted something in the spidery language of the Art and that was the last thing I knew.

---

I awoke some time later, strapped to my horse and surrounded by the half-orc and his allies. He was accompanied by two dwarves and an elf; all but the elf wore Harper pins on their lapels, while the sharp-eared one wore no badge of association from what I could tell. My surroundings were familiar and not wholly unexpected: slightly mountainous with a sharp rise to the east and a phenomenal view of the Moonsea to the south and west. I knew where I was even before they told me.

"The Galena Mountains, priest. You're coming with us." The half-orc untied my wrists and forced a smile. "My apologies for the rough handling, but this one" he pointed at the elf "told us of what happened in the Doomvault. The miracles you channeled."

I didn't recognize the elf, but there were many prisoners freed during my trip. I couldn't easily dismiss it, and the half-orc continued:

"Chief Nosnra of the hill giants isn't expecting us, and this is not an assault on their steading. Those Zhents would've doomed us all had they not consumed my, er, enhanced libations. The chief is an immense creature in power, stature, and will, but is by no means a wise leader. However, we've gathered insight on their activities that seems to indicate that something more is at play – something dark."

One of the dwarves fished a shortsword out from under several layers of oiled leather. The blade's metal was highly polished and seemed to have veins of purple running through it, and as soon as the sunlight played across its face it began to bubble and smoke. In moments, it was gone and only the acrid tang of dissolved metal served to remind me that it ever existed at all.

"Drowcraft. We have reason to believe that the dark elves are planning something big and that it involves the giants. The giants may not be aware of what is unfolding, but we need some place to start our investigation. If the hill giants cannot provide us the answers we need, we must be ready to press forward and proceed through the ranks of the ordning until we either learn the truth or silence the plot."

We crested a hill and ahead stood a large and dilapidated house. Warehouse? Collection of sheds? I wasn't quite sure. I could smell it from this distance, though, and I knew that whatever we might find inside would be a challenge.

But I knew that Silvanus watched over me, and deep down I knew that no matter how foul a plot the giants and drow might have, it could not compare to what the Thayans had wrought.

---

"I could not, at the time, have known how wrong I was – or how hard the next five days would be on me and my new allies. You already know part of the end, for here I stand before you in the hallowed common hall of the Yawning Portal, but the tale that I shall relate to you now is one of grand plans and dire plots and unknowable futures."

I took a long pull from my mug, rubbed my scarred hands, winked at Durnan (unsurprisingly he did not seem to notice me as he was thoroughly fixated on wiping his mugs) and began to dazzle the young adventures of Waterdeep…

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- this adventure runs best with four or five characters at level 11, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 11-16 (tier 3)
- this adventure is actually three adventures: *The Steading of the Hill Giant Chief*, *The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl*, and *The Hall of the Fire Giant King*. Depending upon how much your players wish to roleplay, each of these ‘sections' will probably be 5-10 hours of play.
- you can place *Against the Giants* in various places throughout the Forgotten Realms, including near the Sword Mountains or the Spine of the World. We feel that placing this adventure near the Galena Mountains gives you the best opportunity to bind it into your ongoing games, including those of season 05, Storm King's Thunder; the PDF adventures for season 5 can easily incorporate this adventure!
- when your characters complete *Against the Giants*, consider moving into [DDAL06-03 Crypt of the Death Giants](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/213029/DDAL0603-Crypt-of-the-Death-Giants-5e)!
- magical fire effects have some pretty interesting effects in the Frost Giant Stronghold area – read that section closely
- **Random encounters.** This adventure has the potential for a lot of random encounters. It would be helpful to pregenerate a dozen or so of these encounters so that when they happen, play is not interrupted and you can quickly deploy the encounter for the characters.
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- **Magic items.**
  - *Waythe* is a very powerful weapon and provides an excellent opportunity for a crafty DM to spur its wielder into action
  - this adventure can not award legendary items from hoard rolls under any circumstances
  - the hoard of the white dragons only contains magic items that are specifically called out in the text; all other items are mundane (though potentially quite valuable)
  - the *flame tongue shortsword* (with the detect gems ability) is tradeable in AL games; although this ability deviates from the rules presented in the Dungeon Master's Guide, it is little more than a trinket power and does not disrupt organized play
  - the *mirror of seeing* remains 100 pounds, even if the adventurers claim it – it functions as a *gem of seeing* (including that item's text from the Dungeon Master's Guide, and it can be traded as per normal), but is not considered to be worn equipment so it does not change its size
  - Obmi's *gauntlets of ogre power* function exactly as printed in the Dungeon Master's Guide; the text in Against the Giants is merely a shorthand summary of the item's benefits
  - the Torturer's *+2 greataxe* cannot generally be used by characters in Adventurers League play – per the adventure text, a wielder would need to be size "huge" and also have a Strength score of 25 or greater; it can, however, be traded to a certain merchant of questionable repute when he arrives at your favorite local conventions…
  - any spell scrolls awarded may be selected from the spells present in the Player's Handbook (most often, the DM will pre-determine these spells)
  - the *tome of clear thought* can only be opened by characters with an 18 Intelligence or better per the adventure text
- **Cursed items.** Cursed items are a part of D&D history and often serve a purpose in the story. However, some players might be disappointed and view this as a ‘gotcha' moment – tread carefully. Unless the item's description specifically states otherwise, the characters can cast identify on it (or use a downtime spellcasting activity!) and learn the item's properties, including the curse. Once a cursed item is taken by a character and recorded on their logsheet, a *remove curse* spell only removes the attunement ("de-attunes" from the character) and does not undo the curse.

Thinking outside the box:

- giants are massive creatures – consider doubling the scale of the maps (so, a square would be 20 feet instead of 10 feet)
- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - increase the frequency of patrols
  - consider granting creatures small boosts like the *pack tactics* ability, or granting a feat to a single creature in the encounter (though with great power comes great responsibility; tread carefully!)
- at various points in these adventures, the odds may seem overwhelming. Consider encouraging your characters to make Insight or History checks and then grant them some hints or tips on how to negotiate challenges in a manner that does not entirely revolve around combat
- use the random contents of a giant's bag to spur off-the-cuff story moments
- although this adventure functions very well directly from the page, consider reading about the cultural differences between the various giant tribes – Storm King's Thunder is a great resource for this.
- the drow are a significant threat that, in 1st Edition, were explored in a later series; for 5th Edition play, consider running the characters into DDAL06-03 Crypt of the Death Giants for additional details once they are done with Against the Giants

## Tomb of Horrors

"Durnan cannot possibly be human. He's owned the Yawning Portal for more years than most of us can remember, and he's always the only one behind the bar. Between the trying-too-hard bards and the brawling barbarians and the clerics that come in on a mission to save us from ourselves, I don't know how he does it."

I winked and waved the two good fingers on my left hand at the old coot, and in a short moment Durnan slid two potent mugs of bitter down the bar. Placing my coin on the bar top, I continued:

"He knows things. Seen things. When he talks, you would do well to shut your maw and listen carefully. He owes allegiance to noone, and yet everyone comes in here like it's neutral ground. Even the old paladins don't achieve that level of respect." I paused and took a long draw. "He told me early on that my eagerness would cost me dearly, that I would get in over my head because I wasn't careful – and sure enough, I did. Cost me a couple fingers and a handful of friends – see what I did there? – but I learned that sometimes there are wiser minds than my own. Stay awhile, and listen…"

---

I don't know if the group of adventurers listened like I wanted them to, but I know that when Durnan came over mid-story and admonished them about their behavior they sat right down and got quiet. I was trying to tell them of the story of Skull Hill out in the High Moor; how it only appears during the total eclipse of the first blood moon of the season, of how it is always deathly silent, of how it was filled with traps beyond reckoning, and of how I entered that unholy place once many years ago only to see my friends get consumed by the traps and unknowable dark magic contained inside.

I fear, though, that they only heard "evil lich", "lair", "treasure", and "unexplored" as I spoke. Despite the warnings delivered by both myself and old Durnan, they seemed positively giddy as they paid their tab (and mine, as Durnan slyly added my drinks to theirs). As he had once told me, I knew that their eagerness would get them injured – or worse. Far worse.

It would be several tendays before another adventurer would address me directly in the Yawning Portal. This time, a precocious young halfling woman that was hardly out of her formative years, her eyes as bright as gems and her experience sorely lacking, looked up at me hopefully:

"Silvane? Syndra Silvane? We've – my friends and I, that is, all of us – heard that you needed some help." She produced a tattered broadsheet with my offer of rewards in both coin and exotic magical items in exchange for a trip to Chult.

I smiled, cleared my throat, and began:

"Child, please allow me tell you of the time that a group of adventurers went into the Tomb of Horrors. What they learned was purchased at the dearest of prices, a cost that was at once too great and yet insignificant in comparison to its value. If you make it to the end, then perhaps you will know what lies before you…"

Was I in the wrong for refraining from telling her about my wasting sickness? About the traps that dread Acererak had laid within the Tomb? That annihilation would welcome them, and that only death could be found within? That would be for you, dear augur, to determine.

---

As the vision faded out and the legend lore spell came to its end, Durnan smiled sadly and confirmed that every single adventure that had stepped foot in the Tomb of Horrors had failed to return. Syndra indeed sought allies, but she was seeking allies that could essentially sneak into Chult – where our abilities would be better used in an effort to bring down the Tomb.

Knowing that the odds were against us we decided to set out on our grim task in the morning. The blood moon eclipse was but three days away, and we were armed with her experience – what could go wrong?

### Spoilers below!

For the DM:

- this adventure runs best with four or five characters at level 13, but AL play allows for tables of 3-7 players of levels 11-16 (tier 3)
- this adventure has a significant place in the annals of Dungeons & Dragons history. It is known as a place of death and horror and as such Dungeon Masters are encouraged to run the content as-written and not "pull punches"
- the Tomb of Horrors can be treated as a rumored place of legend, appearing only during the total eclipse of a full blood moon or some other exotic occurrence. If you must place it somewhere within the Forgotten Realms, consider placing it in the High Moor or the Serpent Hills. It is not suggested that you tie the Tomb to the fallen empire of Netheril – their efforts went in other directions than this.
- sometimes the most terrifying thing a villain can do is escape – just be careful to not yank a victory from the characters if they have earned it; defeating an opponent can still feel satisfying even if the opponent disappears (or worse, simply walks away)
- **Entering the Tomb.** It is easy to overlook this, but the adventure does not start inside the Tomb. The characters must find their way in – and there is more than one possible entrance. This portion should be an introduction to what the characters can expect as they get into the Tomb proper; as a DM, use this section to set the mood for the trials ahead.
- **Random encounters.** There are no random encounters inside the Tomb. Acererak does nothing at random, and only allows things to occur according to his great and unknowable plan. A Dungeon Master is well within their rights to prevent long rests from having full benefit inside the Tomb.
- **Timing.** This adventure moves best "at the speed of the party". Dungeon Masters are encouraged to let players make their own decisions on timing, and there is nothing wrong with spending 3-4 sessions inside the Tomb. Also, note that it takes 10 minutes to search a 10 foot by 10 foot space – this is first expressed in the section about the cliff face, but is appropriate for the interior of the Tomb as well.
- **Demonic Attention.** Be sure to read the sidebar at the beginning of the chapter about how the characters might gain the attention of one or more demons. This sidebar can also be triggered if the characters use teleportation magic if the characters are sufficiently powerful.
- **Environment.** Tomb of Horrors has been around for many years, and many players and DMs have [wandered its halls](https://wizkids.com/dd-icons-of-the-realms-toa/). Some creative searching may reveal [excellent props and handouts](https://www.pinterest.com/explore/tomb-of-horrors/) created by those that have already come through. Be sure to review them thoroughly before using them in your game, as they might not match this version of the Tomb exactly. [Some DMs have even created alternative riddles](http://www.dragonmag.com/5.0/#!/article/115045/103448400), and there is no shortage of [very excellent digital maps on dmsguild.com](https://www.dmsguild.com/product/193006/Tomb-of-Horrors--Realistic-Maps)!
- **Lycanthropy.** Refer to the standard Adventurers League rules regarding lycanthropy if a character becomes infected. In short: it it's not removed at the end of the adventure, or if the character chooses to play a different adventure before curing it, that character is immediately retired from AL play until the lycanthropy is removed.
- **Magic items (and magic traps).**
  - A certain archway might strip one or more characters of their gear, including their permanent magical items. This does not reduce a character's permanent magic item count.
  - A gem of seeing requires attunement, and will not work until a character does this. Remember that ownership of an item is determined at the end of a session and is not a prerequisite of attunement! If the item is destroyed as per the adventure text, the owner's permanent magic item count is not reduced.
  - If someone's alignment is reversed, lawful becomes chaotic and good becomes evil (and vice versa); neutral can become an alignment of the DM's choice. While this provides a lot of roleplaying opportunities, the characters should be made aware of how they can change back (see the adventure text) and what it means if they do not.
  - If a permanent magic item is destroyed in areas 15 or 19, the owner's permanent magic item count is not reduced.
  - a certain cursed gem will invariably harm those that cast *wish* from it, and because it tells the holder that it can cast *wish*… what reason might the character have to not use it? Also, any character caught in the gem's explosion is permanently killed and is retired from Adventurers League play.
  - if the efreeti is released, it might grant three wishes. Note that this is not the wish spell, and it is limited in what it can create or deliver – in no case can the effect a wish that it grants last beyond the end of this game session
  - the *staff of the magi* is broken, as per the adventure text; as such, it is unusable
  - if the demilich decides to teleport a character, run it as-written: there is no saving throw
  - Acererak's treasure pile is detailed in the Adventurers League FAQ
  - No *sphere of annihilation* that is part of the Tomb of Horrors can be removed from the Tomb of Horrors. At all. Acererak deals with the void directly, and every *sphere* in the Tomb is bound explicitly to him.
- **Cursed items.** Cursed items are a part of D&D history and often serve a purpose in the story. However, some players might be disappointed and view this as a ‘gotcha' moment – tread carefully. Unless the item's description specifically states otherwise, the characters can cast identify on it (or use a downtime spellcasting activity!) and learn the item's properties, including the curse. Once a cursed item is taken by a character and recorded on their logsheet, a *remove curse* spell only removes the attunement ("de-attunes" from the character) and does not undo the curse.

Thinking outside the box:

- with tables of 6-7 players, consider some ways to increase the scope of the adventure and keep everyone entertained
  - add 1-2 additional monsters to each combat
  - increase (slightly!) the potentcy of the traps in the Tomb
  - consider granting creatures small boosts like the *pack tactics* ability, or granting a feat to a single creature in the encounter (though with great power comes great responsibility; tread carefully!)
- the demilich has grand plans outside of the Tomb of Horrors – consider dropping hints about Chult and the Soulmonger!
- using some non-mechanical things to mark time can really drive home the sense of urgency. For example, in a time of need you may need to verbally – and without additional interaction – count down slowly from 10 to 1; if the characters have not come to a consensus, they may be subject to terrible effects (check the adventure text for examples)
- Dungeon Masters can get  limited-time special certificate from Fai Chen throughout the end of s6 and all of s7 – work with your local events to ensure that Fai Chen attends!
