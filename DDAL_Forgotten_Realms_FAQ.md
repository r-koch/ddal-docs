## Part 1. Welcome to the D&D Adventurers League

### What is the D&D Adventurers League?

The D&D Adventurers League is official organized play for Dungeons & Dragons and uses the fifth edition rules. For the most part, this document concerns itself with the Forgotten Realms campaign, which encompasses most of the adventures and play for the D&D Adventurers League.

### Do I Need A DCI Number or Wizards Account?

No. Wizards of the Coast no longer uses DCI numbers. Having a Wizards Account may prove beneficial in the future, but it is not required. You can obtain one [here](https://accounts.wizards.com/); simply click on "Create Account" to get started.

### What Adventures Can I Play?

Players aren't restricted to the current season's adventures; you can play any D&D Adventurers League adventure set in the Forgotten Realms with any character created for that campaign. *Eberron: Oracle of War* and *Ravenloft: Mist Hunters* are each separate campaigns with their own rules.

### Where Do I Find Adventures?

All D&D Adventurers League adventures are currently available as PDFs in the [DMsGuild](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=45470_0_0_0_0_0_0_0&src=fid45470). A select few free adventures are also available on the [official Wizards website](https://dnd.wizards.com/ddal_general).

### What Counts as an Adventurers League Adventure?

The following general terms apply in describing the various adventures available for play. Listed as well are the adventure codes – a series of identifiers present on the adventure to let you know it's a part of Adventurers League play.

***Official D&D Adventurers League Adventures.*** These are adventures typically available in the DMsGuild store. Most are between two and four hours long, with some higher level adventures playable in six or eight hours. Adventure codes for these include DDEX, DDAL, DRW, and now include the seasonal abbreviation (WBW for *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*). Epic adventures (formally DDEP, now seasonal code-EP) are a special multi-table experience, optimized for large group play.

***Official D&D Adventures.*** These adventures are officially produced and published by Wizards of the Coast. Specific guidance on how to Dungeon Master these adventures for organized play is present in the D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide. This category also includes select products from the Guild Adept section of the Dungeon Master's Guild at [www.dmsguild.com](http://www.dmsguild.com/).

***Community Created Adventures.*** These are produced by designers in the Adventurers League community and are available for purchase on the DMs Guild. Adventure codes for these include CCC (older) and season code-DC (newer, Dungeoncraft). In addition, two premiere organizers – Baldman Games and Gamehole – offer adventures set in specific regions (Moonshae Isles and Border Kingdoms). They bear either the CCC code (older) or PO code (newer).

***Administrator Only Adventures.*** These are special adventures created by the D&D Adventurers League administrators or Wizards staff. Some are available in the DMsGuild.

***Other Content.*** If you have a question, look for the logo (either the "AL Official" logo or the "AL Community" logo) – everything currently available for public play should be in the DMsGuild; some free content may also be available on the official Wizards site.

### How Many Players Can I Have at My Table?

For the best experience, it's recommended that tables have five players—not counting the DM. That said, you can have as few as three players and as many as seven. Having more or fewer players is strongly discouraged to prevent a poor play experience.

Players can play one of their own characters at a time. DMs can't play a character.

DMs (or event organizers) may limit the size of their table to any legal table size.

### What Rules Do I Use?

All Adventurers League games are played using the fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons rules—house rules and Variant and optional rules, except specifically called out in documentation, aren't permitted for use.

Adventurers League Dungeon Masters are empowered to adjudicate the rules as presented by the official materials (*PH*, *DMG*, *MM*, etc.). Run the game according to those rules, but you are the final arbiter of any ambiguities that might arise in doing so. House rules aren't permitted for use in play; the campaign uses the rules as presented in the *PH*.

#### Variant and Optional Rule Availability

See the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide or DM's Guide for specific available rules.

Without specific campaign documentation, any other variant or optional rules aren't available for use.

### Official Rule Sources

Rules from an official D&D Adventurers League source – the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide, DM's Guide, or this FAQ, establish the boundaries for our current campaign.

As a general rule, the administrators don't issue official rulings on general rules questions unless it's directly affected by the scope and purpose of the program.

***Sage Advice/Twitter.*** Sage Advice (SA) and tweets from the Wizards of the Coast staff are a great barometer for the ‘rules-as-intended', in any case. The DM can choose to utilize them at their discretion for rules adjudication. The most recent Sage Advice Compendium is located [here](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/sage-advice/sage-advice-compendium).

***Unearthed Arcana.*** Unearthed Arcana (UA) isn't an allowed resource.

### Adventure Logsheets

This logsheet catalogs your character's progression throughout their adventuring career. While the format of your logsheet is up to you, players and DMs are required to maintain one. An official logsheet is located at the [official Adventurers League site](https://dnd.wizards.com/ddal_general).

#### New Logsheet Entries

You should create a logsheet entry for any of your character's noteworthy events, such as playing an adventure, trading a magic item, copying spells in your spellbook, performing a downtime activity, etc.

### Retroactive Guidance

Only use the most current version of the Adventurers League documents, including the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide, DM's Guide, FAQ, Adventure Index, Logsheet, and Adaptation Guide.

In the case of the Adaptation Guide, continue to use the D&D Adventurers League Content Catalogue (for adventures released season 9 and prior) and the separate adaptation documentation for *Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden*, *Candlekeep Mysteries*, and *The Wild Beyond the Witchlight* until the Adaptation Guide becomes available in early 2022.

## Part 2. Player Questions

### Allowed Rules Resources?

Allowed rules resources are books and other resources that can be used by players in creating, advancing, and playing their characters.

***What is Campaign Documentation?*** Certificates provide characters with additional rules options other than those listed in the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide. These certificates are typically issued through special events.

#### Reprinted Rules

The most current version of any rule is used—even if it's reprinted in another book.

#### Player Use of DM Materials

The following guidance applies in determining what rules from a DM resource are available for players:

***Dungeon Master's Guide.*** Player use of the DMG resources is limited to the properties of magic items that you might find in your adventures. This means that equipment described in the DMG (poisons, etc.) isn't available for purchase.

***Monster Manual.*** Creatures with complete stat blocks found in the *Monster Manual* and other resources listed in the ALPG are available for use with class features such as Wild Shape, Beast Companion, and various *conjure* spells. As always, your DM is the final arbiter for the rules, such as determining whether or not your character has satisfied requirements such as those imposed by your class (such as the druid's requirement to have seen the beast in question).

***Adventures.*** Player use of adventures is limited to properties of magic items found within as well as the use of complete stat blocks for the purposes outlined for Monster Manual, above.

### Beginning Play

You may create a new character at 1st level or 5th level (see the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide). DMing and playtesting adventures, however, you earn levels that can applied to your other characters.

#### Leveling Out

At the conclusion of each adventure, you may choose to gain a level. If you choose to level your character beyond the level range of an adventure, you cannot participate in that adventure with that character.

### Races & Classes

#### Path of the Battlerager Barbarian

Only dwarves may be a Battlerager.

#### Reskinning Races

You may reskin your race (playing a rare elf subrace, for example) if you choose, but have the traits of a normally available subrace (high elf, etc.); the character creation process doesn't change. Your DM may disallow this if they feel it inappropriate.

#### Availability of Nonstandard Familiars

If your character casts *find familiar*, your choice of familiars is limited to the list provided by the spell's description (or the class feature for some warlocks).

Without specific campaign documentation, creatures found in other resources (such as the *Monster Manual* or a book adventure) aren't available as familiars.

#### Level 20 Characters

Once you reach level 20, you may continue to adventure if you so choose.

***Levels.*** After play of each adventure, you still earn all of the associated rewards (such as downtime), but you remain 20th level. This includes the opportunity to rebuild your character.

***Service Rewards.*** You can apply service rewards to a 20th level character.

***Epic Boons.*** Epic boons can only be awarded if the DM is specifically directed to do so by an adventure or other officially released product.

#### Artificer Infusions

Artificer infusions do not count as carried magic items. Artificers can infuse items at the start of an adventure.

***Repeating Shot.*** The item being infused must be of a type generally available for purchase in the campaign (i.e., no firearms).

### Skills & Backgrounds

#### Custom Backgrounds

You can create a custom background for your character by following the rules in the *PH*, but you can't create custom background features. Note that this also means you're able to recreate most backgrounds from sources that use existing features.

#### Learning Exotic Languages

Characters may choose exotic languages from any allowed rules source used for character creation. Druidic, thieves' cant, and other languages that are features of a class or background are not eligible choices for this purpose.

### Equipment & Magic Items

#### Purchasing Mundane Equipment

Characters can purchase any equipment found in any resources available. They can also purchase any spell components necessary to cast any spells in these same resources.

Unless specifically described as otherwise in an adventure or other resource, armor is made of the materials described in the *PH*.

#### Treasure

Characters earn treasure they claim as listed in the treasure sections of encounters; additional treasure cannot be earned. Apart from treasure, characters may earn gold by selling claimed mundane equipment for half its value, subject to DM discretion based on the equipment's condition.

Treasure is converted to gold and divided equally amongst all characters at the end of an adventure. You may choose to dictate the form of your gold at any point (for example, you could possess 600 gp in five 100 gp emeralds fixed in a 100 gp necklace).

#### Equipment in Stat Blocks

Equipment in a creature's stat block (most common with NPCs) can be claimed and sold by characters, provided it is listed in the *PH*. Any equipment a creature possesses that is not listed in the *PH* can be used for the duration of the adventure subject to DM approval, but cannot be sold or kept.

#### Magic Item Counts/Limits

These are old terms present in some past adventures that are no longer used. At the conclusion of an adventure, all participating characters receive a single copy of any intact (wasn't consumed, lost, or destroyed during the adventure) magic item earned with a unique name.

#### Magic Items Categories

All magic items are categorized as either:

***Consumable Magic Items.*** Anything that has a single use and is consumed upon use (or rendered non-magical after use) is a consumable item. This includes potions, scrolls, *smokepowder*, and other single-use items. Items that have multiple uses before being completely consumed (such as *Keoghtom's ointment*) count as multiple consumable items for purposes of the items you can carry per adventure.

***Permanent Magic Items.*** Any magic items that aren't consumable magic items. In addition, this includes magic items that have a chance at being destroyed upon use (staves, wands, *horn of blasting*, etc.), have multiple conditional uses that consume it but have another effect (*scarab of protection*, etc.), and unbreakable ammunition.

#### Choosing Magic Items

If an adventure specifically allows you to choose a magic item, your choice must be from either the *DMG* or the adventure that awards the item. If the adventure doesn't specify a rarity, the item must be tier appropriate to your character. If you're allowed to choose an item of a specific rarity, you can choose one of a lesser rarity. For example, if you are awarded a rare consumable magic item, you can choose an uncommon one instead.

Additionally, if you're able to choose the type of a magic item, you can only choose a type (longsword, longbow, studded leather, etc.) that is otherwise available for purchase.

#### Tier Appropriate Items

Some rewards award a tier appropriate magic item to your character. This is determined by your tier compared to the item's rarity:

Tier | Appropriate Rarity
--- | ---
1 | Common, uncommon
2 | Common, uncommon, rare
3 | Common, uncommon, rare, very rare
4 | All except unique and artifacts

#### Items With Persistent Effects

You can only benefit from a magic item that grants the same permanent benefit once (e.g., *tome of understanding*, some effects from a *bag of beans*, etc.). This guidance is retroactive. Further, items that bestowed a persistent effect (such as a *manual of golems*, *wishes* from *luck blades*, etc.) count against that character's items carried for as long as they retain the benefit, even if the item is consumed. You can choose to abandon the effect (reverting the persistent benefit) to regain the carried slot. Once you revert a persistent benefit, you cannot gain that specific benefit again.

***Multiclass Characters.*** If abandoning an item would render your character ineligible for multi-classing into a class of which they possess a level, you must rebuild your character's ability scores to qualify for your classes.

#### Cursed Items

Unless specified as a story item, you either keep a cursed magic item as a part of your carried items or you must remove it from your owned items. If the curse would remove your character from play, you must either remove the magic item or retire your character. Playable cursed magic items may be traded.

#### Story Items

Characters that find a story item can keep and use the item without it counting against their Magic Item Limit, but only during that storyline. Only one character at the table can use a story item at a given time. These items can't be sold or traded.

#### Problematic Items

Some items are problematic and have been removed from Adventurers League play. Specific items are addressed in the appendix here, or for official D&D adventures, see the D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide.

#### Unique Magic Items

Items without a specified rarity are of like rarity to items found in the *DMG* unless they possess additional, mechanical properties outside of the Special Features tables on pages 142 and 143 of the DMG. Those items with a rarity but which also possess unusual properties are unique and can't be traded.

Any items which don't provide a rarity that also don't have a rarity provided by the adaptation guide are also considered unique unless you have a certificate which establishes its rarity. You must possess an original, physical certificate (i.e., not a photocopy, photograph, scanned copy, etc.) of the certificate from the item in question, specifically from the adventure where it was obtained and it must accompany the trade.

#### Certificates With Errors

If an error exists, use the item description as listed within the adventure itself, and the item's metadata (rarity, attunement requirements, item category, etc.) listed in the *DMG*.

#### Items With Additional Properties

Your DMs should provide the full item description to their players, and/or provide photographs or photocopies of each item as they are presented in the adventure for their players. It is up to you to make sure that you keep accurate track of any additional properties in your adventure logsheet.

#### Attune to a Magic Item by Familiars

Any item attuned to a creature under your control (familiars, beast companions, etc.) counts against your items carried and your items attuned.

This doesn't suggest that such creatures can attune to magic items. Whether or not a mindless undead creature, for example, can attune to and utilize a magic item is still subject to DM discretion.

#### Trading Magic Items

You may trade magic items as per the guidance given in the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide.

#### Destroying Magic Items

Unless the conditions of an item's destruction are specifically stated (talon card from *deck of many things*, *ioun stone*, *+2 nets*, etc.) permanent magic items can't be destroyed. That said, DMs shouldn't make a point of destroying magic items whenever the opportunity presents itself; these situations should be few and far between. Destroyed magic items count as a carried item until the end of the adventure.

#### Bag of Beans & Mummy Lords

See guidance on giving out magic items and benefiting from an item more than once, above. In this case, the mummy lord has neither a specific loot table nor does it award specific items. As such, you receive no magic items for defeating it.

### Renown & Factions

#### Custom Factions

The omission of a set list of authorized factions is intentional to allow characters to become members of any faction they come across in their adventures. However, this has the added benefit of characters creating their own factions. Renown benefits are not available unless specifically a part of a storyline or adventure.

Due to their pronounced role as villains in the *Dreams of the Red Wizards* series of adventures, the Red Wizards of Thay aren't available as a faction.

### Other Rewards

#### Repeating Downtime Activities

Downtime activities that can be repeated are found in the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide. Other downtime activities specific to the adventure are available only once, unless otherwise specified.

#### Event Awards & Other Certificates

Some events offer special certificates known as Event Awards. These have also been known as Legacy Awards in the past. Each is a full color certificate that features an item, pet, or other minor benefit similar in power to a common magic item. These are owned by the player and not attached to a specific character. At the beginning of an adventure, you may select one of your event awards to use for that character during play. You may not change the event award during play of the adventure (or session, in the case of official D&D adventures).

There are other certificates issued in the past that allow players to create a character with a rules option unavailable in the D&D Adventurers League Forgotten Realms campaign (such as a race, or in a few cases, a subclass). These are still valid, but the conditions specified must be followed to use them. The only current exception to this is the Oathbreaker paladin subclass (see below).

The last category of certificates are magic items obtained from events and the Trading Post. These are treated like any other magic items in the campaign, except they have documentation that must be traded alongside the item.

#### Oathbreaker Paladins

The Oathbreaker paladin subclass was available through a special certificate. The D&D Adventurers League Forgotten Realms campaign no longer allows evil characters. Therefore, any character with this subclass must rebuild their character or retire the character.

Players have through December 31, 2021 to complete the rebuild process for these characters.

### Spells

#### Items Created by Spells

Spells or effects that create items such as trade goods and equipment can only create items that are otherwise available for purchase. Items created that are not available for purchase (such as berries created from the *goodberry* spell) are subject to the rules listed in the spell or magic item description.

#### Reincarnation

The DM rolls on the table provided in the spell's description in the *PH*—the race can't be chosen.

You continue to advance in whatever classes you already possess but may be disqualified from future choices. Some feats, however, have a requisite race. Per the *Player's Handbook*, if you fail to meet a feat's requirements, you can no longer utilize that feat.

#### Plane Shift, Et. Al.

If your character was transported to another plane and the adventure doesn't provide them with an apparent way to return, the means by which they do so depend on the following three questions:

- ***A.*** You can cast a spell that allows planar travel.
- ***B.*** You have the spell prepared.
- ***C.*** You have the necessary components.

***A., B., and C. are True.*** You can cast the spell on their next turn and return to play normally. You return to a nearby place of your choosing.

***A. is True, B. or C. are False.*** Spend one downtime day preparing the spell or purchasing components and cast it the following day. This may remove you from some aspects of the adventure, but you are treated as though you have returned prior to the adventure's conclusion for rewards purposes.

***A. is False.*** You may return your character to play at the conclusion of the adventure. You may still gain a level, but do not receive any rewards from the point in which you were removed from the adventure.

#### Clone

The following guidance applies:

***Maturity.*** A clone isn't mature (and therefore provides no benefit) until the recipient spends a total of 120 downtime days after casting it. These downtime days are spent on other activities as per the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide or as present in adventures. However, a vessel used for growing and housing a clone can't be used for another clone until the first clone has been utilized.

#### Simulacrum

Simulacrums can't cast simulacrum, or any spell that duplicates its effects.

#### Teleportation Circle

The following guidance applies:

***It Takes Time.*** Scribing a permanent teleportation circle is a downtime activity that requires the expenditure of a total of 365 downtime days. These downtime days needn't be spent consecutively.

***Not Just Anywhere.*** Only teleportation circles made at the following locations are permanent:

- ***Properties You Own.*** Ownership of buildings or businesses in a specific location.
- ***Established Temples.*** Temples dedicated to faiths of which you are a member.
- ***Other Organizations.*** The headquarters or permanent base of operations of official organizations of which you are a member (Brotherhood of the Cloak, factions, etc.).

***Gaining Access to Other Circles.*** You may trade knowledge of the location and sequence of a circle you've created with someone else, who provides you the location of one in exchange. Both parties to the trade must spend 10 downtime days to complete the trade and learn the circle's sigil sequence, with the following additional guidance:

- ***Temples.*** The downtime cost is halved if both parties to the trade are members of the same faith.
- ***Organizations.*** The downtime cost is halved if both parties to the trade are members of the same organization (usually factions). The location of these circles can't be traded with non-members.

#### True Polymorph

The effects of this spell are removed at the end of the adventure.

#### Wish

The following guidance applies:

***Must Be Overseen by the DM.*** Due to the risks inherent in casting wish, it must be cast in the presence of a DM during an adventuring session.

***Reality Repairs Itself.*** The effects of any wish made for something outside of the bulleted list in the spell's description are at the DM's discretion using the guidance provided in the spell's description and expire at the end of the adventure or the session—whichever comes first.

***Stressful Things Are Stressful.*** Casters run the risk of stress-induced effects incurred by casting wish regardless of whether or not the effects of the wish are temporary. Losing the ability to cast wish in the future can be undone only by wishing for a reroll (as detailed in the spells description).

***You Are You; and So Is It.*** If a simulacrum you have created casts wish, both you and your simulacrum suffer the stress associated with casting the spell—including the risk of being forever unable to cast wish again. The inability to cast wish extends to any simulacrum you create in the future, as well as wish cast by deities via Divine Intervention or other, similar class features.

***Table Boundaries.*** Only characters in your group may benefit from a wish that you cast. The benefits don't extend to other groups or tables.

## Part 3. Dungeon Master Questions

### Earning and Redeeming Service Rewards

Service rewards (formerly known as DM rewards) provide DMs and other participants additional advancement and treasure options in recognition of their contributions to the D&D Adventurers League program.

#### Logging Service Rewards

Just as with an adventure logsheet, there is no mandatory format for logging service rewards. The only requirement is that your log must be available and legible before and during play.

#### Applying Rewards

Rewards may only be applied to one character for each reward earned. You may choose not to apply a reward, reserving the reward for later application.

### Adventure Participation & Party Questions

#### Requisite Character Level

Each adventure lists a minimum and maximum character level (typically expressed as a level range, such as levels 1-4 or levels 1-15). Whether or not a character outside of this range can participate in the adventure depends on the type of adventure.

#### Official Adventurers League Adventures

These adventures typically use the following ranges and can't be played by characters outside of that level range.

***Levels 1-2.*** This level range is usually used for introductory adventures.

***Levels 1-4, Levels 5-10, Etc.*** These level ranges coincide with the four tiers of play.

#### Community Adventures

These adventures have level ranges that coincide with the four tiers of play. They can't be played by characters outside of the listed level range.

#### Official D&D Adventures

Most of these adventures are multi-session adventures from a book or boxed set product. A character can only play one official D&D adventure at a time. If character playing one official D&D adventure starts to play a different one, and levels outside of the first adventure's level range, they can't return to the first adventure. If the adventure allows for play across tiers, then characters may be of any of the levels allowed for the adventure. The DM may, at their discretion, disallow a character to participate if a character's level is too disparate from the specific section of the adventure even if the character is still within the stated level range of the adventure. For example, if the adventure section is built for 3rd level characters and a player brings a 9th level character to play it, the DM may decide that the level disparity is too great for that character to play. In general, this should not be considered until a character is at least three levels above the recommended level for the section.

***Tiers.*** Some official adventures use specific tiers of play for sections instead of a single level range for the entire book. These are identified in the D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide.

#### Mixed-Tier Parties

Provided they're able to play in the adventure, characters of different tiers can adventure together. Some DMs choose to avoid mixing tiers in order to maximize ease of play—restricting play to a specific tier within the adventure's level range.

When adventuring in a mixed-tier party, be careful to avoid overwhelming lower-level characters while still providing a challenge for their higher-level groupmates. If a character falls within 1 or 2 levels of the Average Party Level (APL), they should have no problem fitting into a group, but characters of different tiers may find the adventure too difficult or may make it too easy for their companions.

### Substituting Monsters

Dungeon Masters may add or remove thematically appropriate monsters to adjust an encounter's difficulty as noted in the "Challenge Your Players" section of the **D&D Adventurers League (Forgotten Realms) DM's Guide**. You may choose monsters from official D&D products available for use in the Forgotten Realms campaign (this includes most book adventures and many supplements, except ones for other settings). You may not choose monsters that appear exclusively in D&D Adventurers League or community adventures.

### How Does Advancement Work?

In general, whenever a character completes an official D&D Adventurers League adventure or a community adventure, they can gain a level. They may decline advancement if they wish, but still gain the other benefits of adventure completion (such as downtime days).

***Official D&D Adventures.*** The D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide has guidance on when to award a level for official D&D adventures. In the absence of guidance, the DM may award a level whenever they deem it appropriate to a maximum of one level per session of play (minimum 2 hours) and a minimum of one level per 8 hours of play. DMs should look at future sections in the official adventure to ensure that levels are gained when appropriate based on the adventure.

### Awarding Rewards

As a general rule, if it is found in an adventure, the characters can take it and use it during the adventure. Treasure and magic items must appear in a treasure section or the adventure rewards/summary section at the end of the adventure in order for it to be permanently claimed.

***Mundane Gear.*** Non-magical equipment found throughout the adventure may not appear in sections listed above, but may still be kept and sold for half value at the conclusion of the adventure. The DM has discretion on whether an item can be sold based on its condition.

#### Awarding Magic Items

Characters can find magic items that are specifically mentioned in the encounter in which it's found. Magic items are always annotated in italics. If the item isn't italicized, it isn't a magic item.

#### Magic Ammunition Quantities

Parcels of *+X ammunition* are found in lots of 5 (unless otherwise specified). Any other magical ammunition is found individually.

#### The Adventures Directs Me/the Player to Pick the Item

If an adventure specifically allows the player or the DM to choose an item for their character to unlock, the item selected is chosen from either the *DMG* or the adventure in which the item is awarded. If the adventure does not specify the rarity of the item, it must be tier-appropriate to the character receiving it (see the D&D Adventurers League DM's Guide).

#### Awarding Nonstandard Armor

Unless specifically mentioned in the adventure or encounter it is found in, armor is made of the materials described in the PHB.

### Chapters as One-Off Adventures

Chapters of book adventures can be run in one-off sessions, but not individual encounters.

### Session vs. Adventure

A session is defined as an instance of play from when the group agrees to begin playing until the group decides to end. Most sessions last between 2-8 hours. An adventure is defined as the entirety of a single product's play. For most Adventurers League adventures, session equals adventure. For most official D&D adventures, an adventure consists of multiple sessions.

### How Do Multiple Session Adventures Work?

Whether due to time constraints, or adventure length, adventures may take multiple sessions.

#### Replaying and Continuing Content

A specific character can't replay content but may continue content that they didn't complete. Players and the DM must agree to complete the adventure within a specified future time; if a player is unable to make an agreed-upon play extension and the game proceeds without them, they forfeit future play and rewards with that character (although they may replay the adventure with a different level-appropriate character). If a player misses a session of an official D&D adventure (such as one from a book product), they may return to play at any time agreed upon by the DM and players, and only forfeit rewards from missed sessions.

If extended play occurs, appropriate entries should be noted on logsheets to reflect this.

#### Logging Multi-Part Sessions

Players must complete a log entry at the end of each session. However, it is recommended that characters participating in a multiple-session adventure also record their characters current hit points, and other expended resources (hit dice, spell slots, rages, etc.) in the notes section of their log entry, as such resources are not refreshed between sessions of the same adventure.

#### Playing Other Adventures Between Sessions

Characters can play other adventures (including other multiple-session adventures) between sessions. At the start of each new adventure, the character's hit points, hit dice, and other consumable resources are restored to full. If the character is subject to negative effects from previous play it carries over to each session of play, including starting a new adventure.

Players are advised to keep careful track of resources at the end of each session so that when they return to a multi-session adventure, they can accurately establish their status.

Players taking their characters from game to game in this way are permitted to advance in level and earn rewards between sessions of a multiple-session adventure but must exercise caution to ensure they do not render their character ineligible for play through level advancement.

#### Leveling Between Sessions

Characters gain the full benefit of leveling in between sessions, but expended hit points, spell slots, and other consumable resources don't refresh between sessions until the character rests or the adventure is completed.

All other benefits of gaining a level (including newly acquired abilities) are available immediately. This requires some suspension of disbelief on the part of the players and DM, especially in the case of the character gaining new equipment, magic items, or class features between sessions.

### Using Rules in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*

You may use any rules options listed in Chapter 4: Dungeon Master's Tools of *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*, with the exception of sidekicks and environmental hazards.

### Official Adventure Errata

What follows is errata for past official Adventurers League adventures:

***DDEX2-13 The Howling Void.*** This is a 4-hour adventure.

***DDEX3-5 Bane of the Tradeways.*** This is a 2-hour adventure.

***DDAL05-02 The Black Road.*** This adventure is optimized for five 3rd-level characters.

***DDAL05-03 Uninvited Guests.*** This adventure is optimized for five 3rd-level characters.

***DDEP05-01 The Iron Baron.*** The Flameborne Armor story award allows the creation of a new suit of armor with a maximum market value of 750 gp. The effect of the story award can't be combined with other suit of magical or mundane armor—it is the creation of an entirely new suit of armor.

***DDAL07-01 A City on the Edge.*** This adventure consists of five, 1-hour mini-adventures.

## Part 4. Event Organizer Questions

### Becoming an Event Organizer

Becoming an event organizer is as simple as finding players and a DM and running official D&D Adventurers League games. See the Organizer's Guide for more tips and tricks on organizing.

### Obtaining Adventures for your Event

Each Dungeon Master should be responsible for obtaining a copy of the adventures you want to host.

#### Check the DMsGuild!

Almost all of the adventures playable in the D&D Adventurers League outside of official D&D adventures are available for sale in the [DMsGuild](https://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=45470_0_0_0_0_0_0_0&src=fid45470). If the adventure is not available in the DMsGuild or as an official D&D adventure, it is likely not currently playable in the Adventurers League.

#### Official D&D Adventures

*Lost Mine of Phandelver*, *Dragon of Icespire Peak*, and book adventures produced by Wizards of the Coast are available for Adventurers League play. See the D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide for details. These adventures are best suited for tables which meet regularly (such as private games) but can easily be scheduled in weekly Adventurers League games, should you choose to do so.

#### Converting Other Adventures

You may not convert other adventures for play in the D&D Adventurers League, even if they are published by Wizards of the Coast. All adapted adventures are listed in the D&D Adventurers League Adaptation Guide.

## Part 5. Recent Updates

On September 22, 2021, a new D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide was released, which contained a number of large changes to some of the specific rules in place for organized play in the D&D Adventurers League Forgotten Realms campaign. It is not a comprehensive rules document, and as such, several questions have arisen on specific rules interactions from the changes. This section answers many of them.

### Purchasing Scrolls

*Q. Does the cost of purchasing a scroll include the component cost?*

A. The cost of components is in addition to the scroll's cost.

### Carrying Magical Ammunition

*Q. How is ammunition counted with regards to carrying limits for consumables?*

A. Each stack of five pieces of ammunition is counted as one consumable for carrying purposes, rounded up.

### Persistent Playable Negative Effects

*Q. At the end of an adventure, do you have to remove a curse or disease that doesn't remove the character from play?*

A. You may choose to remove any curse or disease at the conclusion of an adventure. If the negative effect would not remove your character from play or create a disruptive experience during play, you may continue to be under the effects of the curse or disease for the duration of that adventure. Once the choice is made, and the DM has permitted it, you must be under the effects of the disease or curse until the end of the adventure. Once a disease or curse is removed (either through actions in play, or through your choice at the end of an adventure), you cannot reapply the removed effect.

### Level 5 Magic Item

*Q. Can level 6+ characters choose an item obtainable by level 5 characters?*

A. Any character that achieved level 5 or greater prior to September 22, 2021 may choose one item from the list provided in the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide.

### Order of Scribes and Downtime

*Q. How do the features for the Order of Scribes wizard interact with downtime activities, such as copying spells and scribing scrolls?*

A. The Wizardly Quill feature allows you to copy 10 spells of 4th level or lower for 1 downtime day, or 5 spells of 5th level or higher for 1 downtime day. The Master Scrivener feature halves the number of downtime days required for scribing scrolls, rounded up.

### Logsheet Requirements

*Q. It says you should use a logsheet to keep track of your adventure records. Is this a requirement?*

A. You are required to log your play. You can use an official logsheet or anything else that is clearly legible and has all the requisite information.

### Renown and Faction Items

*Q. Are renown and faction items that were previously awarded but no longer available able to be kept by characters that possess them?*

A. Yes, any renown or faction magic items earned prior to September 22, 2021 are still owned by their respective characters.

*Q. Are former renown and faction magic items tradeable?*

A. If you earned renown and faction items prior to September 22, 2021, they are considered owned items and are tradeable.

### Evil Magic Items

*Q. There are some past adventures that award magic items that require attunement by an evil character. Are these items going to be replaced with something else?*

A. There are no replacements for these items.

### Returning After a Long Break

*Q. What if a character hasn't played in several years? How do I update them?*

A. Reduce the character's magic item count to the carried item maximums as noted in the D&D Adventurers League Player's Guide before playing again.

### Part 6. Miscellany

Here are a few other questions that have recently been asked.

### Fey Gifts from Dungeoncraft

*Q. I earned a fey gift that allowed me to choose a feat for downtime days and gold, but I see it's been removed as an option now. What happens?*

A. Feats are no longer a reward option for WBW-DC adventures. If you selected one, remove it and refund the gold and downtime days spent. If the adventure replaced it with a different fey gift, you may select that gift instead (paying any applicable costs).

### Nightwalker Death

*Q. If I die to a nightwalker, what happens?*

A. You choose your character's fate at the conclusion of the adventure, following the guidance of the **D&D Adventurers League (Forgotten Realms) Player's Guide.** This is exceptional in that specific rules override general ones. In this case the campaign's rules take precedence.

### Magic Item Degradation by Monsters

*Q. How are permanent magic items affected by monsters whose stat blocks specifically interact by those magic items (for example, Juiblex or zorbo)?*

The creature's stat block specifically calls out in the rules how it negatively impacts the item. There are a few ways that items could be repaired during an adventure:

- Mending could work subject to DM adjudication on smaller items.
- Smith's tools and a forge repairs metal items (*XGE*).
- Tinker's tools repairs other materials (*XGE*).

In the case of Juiblex/zorbo actions, if the item isn't permanently destroyed, the magic item is repaired at the end of the adventure. However, if it is destroyed, it's gone.

### Find Greater Steed and Dragonnel

*Q. Can I summon a dragonnel (FTD) with find greater steed (XGE)?*

A. Yes.

## Appendix C. Magic Items Unavailable for Play

### Unavailable Items

Some items offered within playable adventures are problematic for play in D&D Adventurers League. These items are unavailable for play. If you have a character that possesses one of these items, remove it from your character. DMs should not award these items wherever they appear with no exceptions.

- *+1 mithral splint armor*
- *Bookmark*
- *Dawnbringer*

### Converted to Story Items

Some magic items are allowed to be kept and used during play of the adventure they're found in but are too problematic outside of that adventure. These magic items are converted to story items. At the beginning of each session of play for the adventure in question, a group with one or more characters in possession of a story item must choose one character to carry that item for the duration of the session. A group cannot have two or more of the same story item in play. These items each count as a carried magic item for characters using them during play. These items are not subject to rarity restrictions for characters carrying them.

Note that the list below includes only magic items converted to story items; there are many more story items present within adventures. See the adaptation guides for specific adventures for more details.

- *Drown*
- *Figurine of Orcus*
